1:Before thou attacketh thine enemies to the west, thou must needs kill off the scouts ensconced nighto the north. If thou dost left-click on thy lance carriers, and then right-click on thine enemies, this shall spur theminto a glorious attack.
2:A company of bowmen lieth to the south-west. Attack it with thy militia. But caution to order thecharge at the proper moment, lest enemy arrowsinflict terrible losses on thy stalwart troops!
3:Attack the enemy forces which lie in waiting to thewest. Watch for enemybowmen for they have entrenched themselves behind the infantry! Send thyscouts to the north that they may encircle theenemy and attackfrom the rear.
4:Now thou shalt launch an attack with all thy forces at once. Place thy bowmen behind thine infantry to drive backthe enemy lines. If thou artglorious, the battle tutorial is complete.
