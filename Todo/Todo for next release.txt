====================================
Since r6157 (Winter Tournament Beta)
====================================

Bugs:
 +	In scripted maps using PlayerShareFog, after loading a multiplayer save fog is changed
 +	When returning to lobby existing spectators should be set as ready
 +	Houses sometimes become partially invisible during construction. When construction is finished the house returns to normal
 +	Hotkeys (1..9) are not saved rehosting the savegame in MP
 +	Wood/Stone on building sites render on top of trees in front of them
 +	Replays show the scripted overlay text for the selected player
 +	Message log is no longer lost when saving in multiplayer, and messages no longer show in replays
 +	Goals created in the MapEd are ignored and cause a warning due to MessageID not being 0
 +	Arrows shot over longer distances would be invisible for the last ~10% of their flight (units die when no one appears to be shooting them)
 +	Andreus' map Castle Defenders: Crash when barracks was destroyed and script adds units in OnWarriorEquipped
	Trees, houses and units near the top row of the map may be visible in places where they overhang the top row of the map
	Improve AI attacks as The Dark Lord suggested
	File transfers needs to not overwrite the original maps in some way (folder for downloaded maps separate from "official" ones?)
 -	After fish depletion message appears "Fisherman too far from the water" [Can't reproduce. Maybe translation mistake or something blocked path to the water so it was too far away?]

Features:
 +	Spectator chat channel (like team)
 +	Hint on campaign menu to explain that you can select flags (nobody finds this feature without asking)
 +	"Return to Lobby" needs to be a vote
	Map descriptions should optionally be from the LIBX file (instead of BigDesc put BigDescLIBX = 5 where 5 is ID in LIBX?)
