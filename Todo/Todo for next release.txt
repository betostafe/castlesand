
Bugs:
 +	In scripted maps using PlayerShareFog, after loading a multiplayer save fog is changed
 +	When returning to lobby existing spectators should be set as ready
 +	Houses sometimes become partially invisible during construction. When construction is finished the house returns to normal
 +	Hotkeys (1..9) are not saved rehosting the savegame in MP
 +	Wood/Stone on building sites render on top of trees in front of them
	Trees, houses and units near the top row of the map may be visible in places where they overhang the top row of the map
	Improve AI attacks as The Dark Lord suggested
	Goals in the MapEd are ignored and cause a warning due to MessageID not being 0
	File transfers needs to not overwrite the original maps in some way (folder for downloaded maps separate from "official" ones?)
 -	After fish depletion message appears "Fisherman too far from the water" [Can't reproduce. Maybe translation mistake or something blocked path to the water so it was too far away?]

Features:
 +	Spectator chat channel (like team)
 +	Hint on campaign menu to explain that you can select flags (nobody finds this feature without asking)
	"Return to Lobby" makes it too easy for host to abuse/troll. Needs to be a vote or something similar
