Features:
 +	MP game speed up slider (1x,2x, 3x)
 +	Coop maps handled better in lobby (AI players hidden and automatic, AI map areas not revealed)
 +	Host can set password for lobby
 +	Army graph starts 5% before the first variation (to skip peacetime)
	Lobby name/description by host (shown in room info and inside the room as 1st message)
	Kick/ban/whisper dropdown when clicking on player flag


Finishing up:
 +	Message log
 +	Finish new MapEd features (add ADD_WARE_TO_LAST)
	SP maps list will keep jumping to the top while items are being added (you can't scroll down until scanning is done)
	Finish AI stuff (defending and attacking prototype?)
	Decide which script commands will be implemented for this release and implement them
	Example maps that show what can be done with new scripts


Known issues to fix:
 +	MP maps are still using auto generated goals. Do we keep it like that? Yes, but "Special" maps don't have auto goals so scripts can customise it
	Campaign/tutorials show warnings about showing messages with goals being depreciated
	ALL MP maps will need SET_USER_PLAYER set for them, since when maps were made with Lewin's editor all locations are AI except the first one


After first RC:
	Ask RC testers to make map from scratch in MapEd
	Magic water in MapEd?
	Check main menu / gameplay interfaces for text that needs to be added to the LIBX (e.g. lobby speed)
	Add missing texts from MapEd to LIBX (maybe ignore some stuff in temporary interfaces that will be improved next release?)
	Send text off to be translated (do this late in the RC testing so translators don't get 3 separate requests for each RC with changed text)


Balance/exploits:
 +	Increased market loss ratio to 2.2
 +	Tested: 4 farms (with unsown fields) + 2 stables beats 6 woodcutters (with 5 grown trees each) + 1 market in horse production by 16% (20 mins), 30% (30 mins), 45% (40 mins), 77% (60 mins)
	Stop builders emptying towers (builders refuse to walk into range of a tower or player blocked from building there?)


Undecided:
	Pawel's flower
	Snow wolf
	Increase player limit to 10?
	Swap players/resources in graphs? (so you compare "who made the most wood?" rather than "did Lewin make more stone than wood?")
	File transfers


Maps:
	Pawel's fixes for campaign missions that he emailed to us
	New coop missions and fixes to coop missions (from andreus, kirelareus, pawel?)
	Iceline (thunder)
	Final Frontier (To)
	Shark Islands (andreus and vovets1)
	To's changes to Accoss the Desert?
	Get latest version of PAKER's maps and decide whether or not to add any new ones
	czechboss' new map
