====================================
Since r6157 (Winter Tournament Beta)
====================================

Bugs:
 +	Lobby map description keeps getting smaller
 +	AI sometimes gets into a loop building and destroying a quarry/gold mine/iron mine
 +	Warrior sounds not working correctly
 +	Sometimes serfs (or another unit) would be selected instead of the unit you clicked
 +	Campaign map screen allowed you to select locked missions
 +	Peacetime was not correctly set to zero when selecting a map with PT disabled
 +	Spectators can end up with the same color as someone in the save
 +	Actions.GiveHouseSite puts fence at X-1
 +	States.UnitHome doesn't work (Unknown error in loading bytecode to Exec)
 +	Returning to the lobby must create paused.sav on all clients to avoid host exploits and refuse to download it if returned to the lobby and paused doesn't match (also don't auto download other saves if we just returned to the lobby, display download button)
	You can start the game before spectators have downloaded save, which causes an error
	Map popularity stats need to store hash too to separate modifications
	Single maps menu: if there are many enemies their flags don't fit: http://i.imgur.com/h4xwK8o.jpg (EDIT: also happens for win/defeat conditions images, allies' flags)
	Warriors who hit an obstacle (diagonal tree) while storming should walk towards leader's final position
	Recheck the map hash before the game starts in case the files were changed

Features:
 +	Hint for "Serfs per 10 houses" should display current number of houses for that player
	Change MapEd color palette to better cover RGB spectrum, but still 256 colors for UI purposes (new static script command needed)
	Allow changing speed in MP when there's only 1 human (for playing vs AI like it's SP)
	Add more Unicode characters to fonts such as misc symbols (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols)


====================================
Fixed in r6478 (RC 1)
====================================

Bugs:
 +	In scripted maps using PlayerShareFog, after loading a multiplayer save fog is changed
 +	When returning to lobby existing spectators should be set as ready
 +	Houses sometimes become partially invisible during construction. When construction is finished the house returns to normal
 +	Hotkeys (1..9) are not saved rehosting the savegame in MP
 +	Wood/Stone on building sites render on top of trees in front of them
 +	Replays show the scripted overlay text for the selected player
 +	Message log is no longer lost when saving in multiplayer, and messages no longer show in replays
 +	Goals created in the MapEd are ignored and cause a warning due to MessageID not being 0
 +	Arrows shot over longer distances would be invisible for the last ~10% of their flight (units die when no one appears to be shooting them)
 +	Andreus' map Castle Defenders: Crash when barracks was destroyed and script adds units in OnWarriorEquipped
 +	Improve AI attacks as The Dark Lord suggested
 +	Barracks rally point should not be rendered in map editor
 +	Trees, houses and units near the top row of the map may be visible in places where they overhang the top row of the map
 +	Reassigning host should not reset room password/description
 +	File transfers needs to not overwrite the original maps in some way (store in MapsDL folder)
 +	File send rate is throttled globally so multiple simultaneous transfers don't lag out the host
 +	MapEd: Autoattack and "fast equip" AI config
 +	MapEd: Button on mission tab to apply our default MP AI builder setup
 +	Interface on MapEd main menu for moving downloaded maps from MapsDL folder to MapsMP if you want to add them to your official list
 +	Some players can't select units in windowed mode (rewrote selection buffer)
 +	Loading a map then saving it as a different name in the MapEd should save .script, .libx and .wav files too
 +	Sounds were not playing for "house unoccupied" and "troop hungry" messages
 -      Create local server, run multiplayer game in 2nd window. You will get Range Check error instead of servers list: http://imgur.com/K27p2Tk (My fault, forgot to add needed sprite [Andreus])
 -	After fish depletion message appears "Fisherman too far from the water" [Can't reproduce. Maybe translation mistake or something blocked path to the water so it was too far away?]

Features:
 +	Spectator chat channel (like team)
 +	Hint on campaign menu to explain that you can select flags (nobody finds this feature without asking)
 +	"Return to Lobby" needs to be a vote
 +	Servers running on the local area network are detected and listed at the top of the server list
 +	Map descriptions should optionally be from the LIBX file (instead of BigDesc use BigDescLIBX with the text index)
 +	AIs can replace humans in saves in the lobby
