EXE-only r1006:
<===================================================================================>
 +	Fixed clicking on empty space in file list in Main Menu
 +	Fixed error when displaying file lists without any files in them
 +	Terrain should flatten under roads/houses on mission start. Discussed with Lewin
 +	Process KillUnit/AddScout commands through GIP, even if they are to be removed soon
 +	Serfs will keep on taking stones to try to deliver them to died workers endlessly
 +	I got a access violation when I was deleting my fisherman. (Must be fixed in r1006/r1036)
 +	Access violations when closing the game window by Alt+F4 (Tasks were not freed properly)
 +	Menu buttons in replay don't work, no way to exit other than F11 (added replay controls)
 +	Sometimes the taskbar stays on top in fullscreen mode
 +	Message should be displayed when replay reaches end (e.g. replay complete, would you like it to continue?)
 +	ct_Attack_Position (!ATTACK_POSITION command in script) has been implemented
 +	Goals and messages from mission script have been implemented
 +	Message stack controls do not anchor to the bottom when resizing the screen
 + 	Troops walking from A to B. If send them to C, they will walk to B and only then to C
 + 	When destroying a building, soldier will attack a citizen walking nearby - he should do that only with soldiers
 +	When using right click to move warriors the direction indicator doesn't appear until the mouse is moved
 +	Occasional crash when loading due to listener not being initialised
 +	Mouse wheel for scrollbars now works much better and in more places
 +	Added repositioning of units and houses in the map editor by right clicking with them selected
 +	Right clicking on the train button in the school now fills the queue with the unit (I always wished I had this for recruits)

 -	Display WIP houses/units in statistics menu
 -	Make units/houses highlight red when about to erase them as trees do (in MapEd)
 -	Dots and lines displaying on tile edges
 
	Colored rectangle below cursor	
	MediaPlayer won't play mp3s and crash
	Some texts don't fit in the left panel (e.g. "Preparing house area")
	See-through hills (lighting flaw)
	Many texts will not change if I change the language in options menu
	Two monitor config, scrolling works well only on 1st display

 -	Serfs should take wares back or to suitable house if destination is destroyed

 ?	Citizen will try to walk home when it has no road tile below entrance (I think thats not a bug)
 ? 	Music doesn't work
 ?	game in fullscreen mode flickers terrible! (TK, tested on TV and LCD, 50Hz?) (Gone in r970 ?)
 ?	when starting the game first time after system boot-up Explorer stops responding for a minute (Win7x64)
 ?	Houses/units from the mission file should not place on forbidden terrain (height, proximity for houses)
 ?	in background there is a rustle, I can hear it very good, if I set music down to "0". deactivating music is the same. (I use a creative x-fi sound card) But it's only in main menu, not in in-game! In in-game you hear a whir like from a bee.



Fixed in KaM Remake Economy Demo 100813 (r970):
<===================================================================================>
 +	Viewport scrolling should be smooth
 +	If you destroy a house, odd things happen to the occupant(s). (not appearing, jittering)
 + 	Rock throwing uses wrong alliance setting
 + 	Map editor won't let you place citizens off roads
 + 	Map editor main menu labels 'Width' x 'Height'
 + 	Masked edit allows for unlimited size
 + 	Scroll wheel now functions correctly on filelist and updates the scrollbar position
 + 	Zooming with the scroll wheel now only works when over the map (not a control)
 + 	Briefings: on fullscreen (1366*768) the message jumps over the right edge of the screen
 + 	"Unit walk not fRouteBuilt" error. (Issue 28)
 + 	Clicking on anything during gameplay will shift viewport a little
 + 	StoneMines mission in r977 crashes on 39min for some delivery being performed twice 
 + 	Multiple units added by ct_SetUnitByStock will stack on one tile after autoplacement fails (~80+ units)
 + 	Occupied tile has no unit on it (Issue 27) (same as above)
 + 	Finished delivery will abandon twice and crash if unit dies while waiting to exit from destination house
 +	Word "Condition" in house menu is unreadable, bad colour, it should be white



Fixed in r734:
<===================================================================================>
+	The woodcutters planting animation is not visible, he simply disappears and reappears when he is done planting.
+	The woodcutter doesn't cut down trees, until all the available spots have been planted. In the original KaM a woodcutter would always cut down fullgrown trees in the first place, and only plant trees when there is nothing to cut down. (TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav) (trees appeared to be fully grown a few minutes before they can be cut)
+	Troop/house buttons not working after clicking on terrain with them selected
+	Laborers are sometimes being trapped inside a digged construction plan (Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav)
+	Range check error in TPR7, (TRB 2010-02-19 Range Check Error.rar) caused by group dying
+	Death task should not wait for action to finish, it should override any action under any circumstances. Otherwise strange things can happen visually e.g. dead units can be "pushed" using interaction sometimes not showing death animation.
+	In game settings uses old sytle brightness control.
+	Main menu options page doesn't refresh if you change the settings in game.
+	After digging house area workers will not continue to walk over other construction sites after leaving the one they made
+	Terrain is now flattened under houses placed at mission start
+	Demolished houses now leave a dug tile where the road used to be, rather than it just disappearing which looked odd (TK's suggestion)
+	F11 statusbar shows wrong map size in loaded games
+	Because the delivery queue prefers closer deliveries, wares will always be delivered to closer buildings. (e.g. with two swine farms, closer one will get all the corn) Same with coal mines. (coal mines in Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav, swine farms in TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav)


?	(Can't reproduce, probably caused by worker-construction site issues that have been fixed now) Walk failed in TPR7 "Unit Laborer unable to walk a route from (97;29) to (98;30) during task Idle since the route is unbuilt" (TRB 2010-02-19 Walk Failed.rar)




Fixed in r698:
<===================================================================================>
+	Confusing fish run-out messages
+	"Unknown unit type in Savegame" due to dead but not yet destroyed units not saving unit type [Lewin]
+	Weapons producing houses did not show produced weapons correctly, only one weapon of each type was displayed
+	Range Check Error in GetSlide function due to PrevPos being two tiles away from NextPos (fix unconfirmed, but 99% certain) [Lewin]
+	Buggy stone mining - in some maps, e.g. 15 TSK, stonemasons get stuck after grabbing a stone, because of the changing elevation and angle (the tile below them becomes unwalkable). Building a road near the trapped stonemason causes an error message like the described before, but then nothing bad happens - he just go home and keep working.
+	Some saves are impossible to load due to the range check error (bug in TKMPointTagList.Load) [Lewin]
+	Instabilities due to rare circumstances causing routes with canWalkRoad to fail when floodfill succeeds [Lewin]
+	Demolishing the building manually exits from the building menu, unlike in KaM, where it takes back to the building selection [Lewin]
+	Load/Save buttons have different order [to KaM], it's a bit confusing [Lewin]
+	Stuck (trapped) fish (especially in "Across the Desert") would try to use canWalk to solve interaction resulting in crashes [Lewin]
+	Returning to road did not use A* efficiently and so would fail over long distances [Lewin]
