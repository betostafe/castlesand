KaM Remake r565
<===================================================================================>
Known bugs:

Gameplay bugs:
	Citizen will try to walk home when it has no road tile below entrance
	MediaPlayer won't play mp3s and crash
	Some texts don't fit in the left panel (e.g. "Preparing house area")
	Flags are always visible
	Sometimes the taskbar stays on top in fullscreen mode

Graphics bugs:
?	Water has dark patches
	See-through hills (lighting flaw)
	game in fullscreen mode flickers terrible!
	brightness settings are wrong (looks like foggy)

Translation bugs:
	word "Language:" will be not change if I change the language in options menu
	language in mission-load-screen ("set textures and tiles"...etc) are not translated, every time in english

Sound bugs:
	in background there is a rustle, I can hear it very good, if I set music down to "0". deactivating music is the same. (I use a creative x-fi sound card) But it's only in main menu, not in in-game! In in-game you hear a whir like from a bee.

Suggested improvements:
+	support for 1920x1080 resolutions (samsung tv's, widescreens etc)
-	make button in load menu "restore/restart last saved game"
	word "Condition" in house menu is unreadable, bad colour, it should be white
	Viewport scrolling should be smooth
	Two monitor config, scrolling works well only on 1st display
