There is no paradise, near or far, that can match the grandeur of the Crystalline Falls. The leaves upon the trees are greener and more lush with life than any in the most fertile of forests. The sand, warm to the touch, is smooth, not course or rough like that upon the beaches of the oceans. The mist of the waterfalls' graceful cascades ease the mind and bring harmony to the soul. Yet, for all the wonders of this eden, the water, itself, is the most magnificent. Clear as crystal, the refreshing rejuvenation from drinking the cool waters promotes health and long life. Come, lay upon the pastures, and behold the sight of the Crystalline Falls. ||"And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal..." ||Capture the outposts at the sides to reveal the map and gain an advantage.||Map by To|Script by Shadaoe|Story by Ben
