They say that a journey begins with the first step. Our expedition will be long but must start with that first step. We are in Arkos, a previously unknown land. We camped for a few months and today we have our first building - a storehouse. Now we begin to explore this land. From our scout we learned about other explorers. We also have news about an abandoned storehouse. We need to get to it as soon as possible and secure it from intruders.||Made by PAKER TEAM||PAKER|Woloszek|Browaar
