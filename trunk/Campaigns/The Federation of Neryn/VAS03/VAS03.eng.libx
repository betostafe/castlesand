0:The situation is calamitous! The nomads are controlling the entire forest from castle Rohel to the coast. Meanwhile Somven has become involved in the war. The troops from Steinbach will defend Aalenburg, but they won't endure much longer. We must recruit new troops promptly!
1:Damn! One of their patrols has already discovered us. It is likely that their planned attacks will be redirected towards you for now.
2:The enemy troops will soon be ready for further attacks. It would be useful to secure the emplacement in the west with watch towers. Strike back once the right moment has come!
