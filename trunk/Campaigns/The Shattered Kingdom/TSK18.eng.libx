0:A deserted storehouse doth perchance lie nigh to your position. Thou shalt travel with all speed to that place, for a hard trial awaits thee, and methinks thou willst be in need of all the aid which thou canst find.
1:Our brave spies report that the deserted storehouse doth indeed be the target of a large enemy offensive. Thou must needs hold firm in this place, lest thine own advance be hindered.|Stand fast, thou brave heart!
2:Yet another dastardly attack on the storehouse cometh thy way. Prepare thyself for battle!
