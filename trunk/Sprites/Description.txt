This folder contains replacement images for original KaM sprites.
In order to replace some sprite you should name it in following format:

#-####.png	Standard sprite
#-####a.png	Alternative sprite (used for team colors)

First digit is RX library index. Second array of 4 digits is sprite index.
For example to replace main menu logo use: 5-0004.png

Images whose indexes are outside of original ranges will be ignored.


When added new sprites to RX7 (rxMenu) you will need to update REMAKE_MENU_SPRITES_COUNT in KM_ResourceSprites.pas

When added new sprites to RX9 (rxGame) you will need to update REMAKE_GAME_SPIRTES_COUNT in KM_ResourceSprites.pas
