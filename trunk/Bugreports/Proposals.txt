Ideas that have not been decided. Should be moved to Bugslist.txt when a decision is made
We can discuss them in dialog-style and maybe move to GC issues later on
<===================================================================================>
	The multiplayer in-game player list could be ordered (grouped) by teams
	Show the player's name above each group (flag holder) while some key is kept pressed (conflicts with per-locale army controls)
		Krom: I think we can discount per-locale army controls (see comment in code and link to GameDev.StackExchange) and implement it
		Lewin: I agree
	Scrolling around the map using middle mouse click, as in TPR
		Krom: Don't have anything against it
		Lewin: Me either
	Speedup for multiplayer by all players selecting a game speed, and it chooses the minimum one (could be annoying)
	Show the mining radius of the selected house or house that you are placing
		Krom: Idea is okay. We need to display mining "strength" (think coalmine) as well, in some nice way, also show ranges of all houses of the same king to allow player to plan his mining better (e.g. avoid overlaps). Iron/Gold don't need this mostly, but Coal/Fish/Towers - do.
	Gameplay modes in multiplayer: no iron, no archers, no market, no towers, etc. Host can select multiple modes.
	People can cheat in MP during peacetime by digging a house/road over an enemy road or free land (block houses on enemy territory during peacetime?)
	AI warriors should automatically engage enemies within 3-4 tiles (happens in KaM?)
	Archers on a hill get slightly longer range (calculated from height of archer tile relative to target tile) {not sure about this one. Probably ruins balance and feel of KaM}
	Separate script command for AI to repair its houses
	New column in load/replays menus: Date/time (from file modified date?)
		Krom: Think we can write/read the data to/from replay/save files as modified date is not very trustworthy
		Lewin: Sounds good
	Add buttons to Replay to see FOW as each player or everything
	Split network protocol (commands) into server-client level (queries, rooms, connecting, disconnecting) and game level (lobby, gameplay)
	New command !SKIP_HOUSE. If I want a map with no stone, then after building the inn the woodcutter and tower should become available (skips the stonemason)
	When player leaves allow his allies to take control over his village and army
	Try extending height to 0..255 rather than 0..100 so it's easier to have multiple "levels" on a map (e.g. plateau with a hill on it)
		Krom: I disagree. This is not as simple as a matter of just extending it. We need to discuss
	Make lobby flag selection using list of countries that speak that language. With English you could choose USA, UK, AU, NZ. With Spanish you could choose Spain, Argininia, Chille.
		Krom: Maybe we can add country selection to options or MP menu, irregardless of options locale
		Lewin: Sounds ok. Means we need to include ~200 flags I guess, but with RXX packing that's no big problem.
	Do not send a Recruit to WatchTower when Player has built it but did not connected it with road
		Krom: I think that makes good sense. But if Player made 10 towers and 10 recruits and only then connected them with roads - will/should recruits walk from Barracks to Towers?
		Lewin: The only case this can happen is when the player starts with the towers right? You can't build a house without connecting it to road. I think it's ok for the recruits to go to the towers, but stones definitely should not.
	Pause button in multiplayer (only host can use it? Or majority of players must press it?)
	Separate crash situations into gameplay (stop the game because recovery is impossible due to wrongful game state after unfinished UpdateState) and UI (where recovery is much more likely)
	Add a button into MapEd to allow quickplay the map
	Increase Towers accuracy slightly, see watchtowers_test.txt
	Add a command to let the AI repair houses without building new ones (wasn't possible in KaM)
	It doesn't make sense for sausages to be cheaper than bread in the market when sauasges are better food
	Blocking duplicate app is annoying if you want to run map editor twice or something. We should only block it when it could be cheating (MP game/replay)
	Clicking and holding on the add/subtract buttons in weapons workshops could increase the number to save repeated clicking
