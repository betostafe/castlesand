=============
Must be done:
=============
 +	Campaign editor tool for the public [Krom]
 +	Remove redundant word-wrapping ("|") from unit descriptions for all languages. Keep the intentional ones that break it into paragraphs. [Lewin]
 +	Statistics page in game in replay should show stats from the last player you selected [Krom]
 +	Fix TSK 19 crash [Lewin]
 +	Update game files from SR3 where approperiate [Lewin]
	Finish charts
	Finish custom campaign support (whats left? Sorting list)
	Block market in original missions through script not code hack [Lewin]
	Multiplayer should have an option to send a flare (beacon) on the minimap to tell allies (or all players) about something.
	Add new music tracks Market and Household
	Update readme with changed info (shortcuts, missing features)
	Add new maps and maybe delete some existing ones based on quality and popularity
	Check if we can use smoothing when scaling menu images up/down [Krom]
	Test all campaign missions for minor script warnings and fix them (e.g. TSK 7) [Lewin]
	Narrator in campaign breifings [Lewin]


==============================
Could be done if we have time:
==============================
 +	Allow to assign groups and houses(!) to Ctrl+0..9 keys
	Show peacetime remaining in MP replays
	If a woodcutter plants a tree where you placed a building site, the site gets canceled (very annoying) due to AbandonWalk and conditions for multiple players building on a tile
	Attacking a house from the bottom right, soldiers will stack up rather than choosing a different free cell (WalkToHouse should avoid other units attacking the house?)
	Translation manager should have an option to only show certain languages, e.g. DE translator can select just DE and EN rather than scrolling through all of them
	Selecting a map in multiplayer should show columns with name, size, player count, etc. rather than dumb drop down
