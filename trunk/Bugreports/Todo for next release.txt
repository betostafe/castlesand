=============
Must be done:
=============
 +	Campaign editor tool for the public [Krom]
	Finish charts
	Finish custom campaign support (whats left?)
	Fix TSK 19 crash [Lewin]
	Block market in original missions through script not code hack [Lewin]
	Statistics screen in replays should show stats from the last player you selected [Krom]
		Krom: I'm not sure this is needed. In SP we would like to see only human player, and in MP all players are equaly visible(?)
		Lewin: In MP replays I can only see the statistics screen (3rd button on in-game panel showing unit/house counts) for the player who saved the replay, I want to see it for everyone. In SP replays I can only see the stats for the human player, and I see no harm in letting people see how many serfs/labourers/schools an AI had.
	Remove redundant word-wrapping new lines ("|") from unit descriptions in .libx for all languages. Keep the intentional ones that break it into two paragraphs though. [Lewin]
	TSK 15 the black AI (player 4) doesn't build because the script contains no !SET_AI_PLAYER (KaM assumes AI by default I guess?) [Lewin]
	Multiplayer should have an option to send a flare (beacon) on the minimap to tell allies (or all players) about something.
	Add new music tracks Market and Household
	Update game files from SR3 where approperiate [Lewin]
	Update readme with changed info (shortcuts, missing features)


==============================
Could be done if we have time:
==============================
 +	Allow to assign groups and houses(!) to Ctrl+5..9 keys
	Show peacetime remaining in MP replays
	If a woodcutter plants a tree where you placed a building site, the site gets canceled (very annoying) due to AbandonWalk and conditions for multiple players building on a tile
	Attacking a house from the bottom right, soldiers will stack up rather than choosing a different free cell (WalkToHouse should avoid other units attacking the house?)
	Translation manager should have an option to only show certain languages, e.g. DE translator can select just DE and EN rather than scrolling through all of them
	Selecting a map in multiplayer should show columns with name, size, player count, etc. rather than dumb drop down
