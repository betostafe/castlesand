Each folder represents a single map (named MAP_NAME through this document).

Folder name should match MAP_NAME

Folder contains all required map files. So far these are:
 - MAP_NAME.txt which contains map properties and description shown in menu
 - MAP_NAME.dat which is a script file of the map
 - MAP_NAME.map which is map terrain
 - MAP_NAME.mi temporary file created by the game which stores the map/mission info so it is not necessary to scan the files each time. It can be safely deleted.
other files may be included later

MAP_NAME.txt notes

 - 	Following options will remain and maybe get changed a little
	Author - author(s) of the map
	SmallDesc - map description given in few words
	BigDesc - large description shown in SingleMap menu when player chooses the map
	SetCoop - Sets this mission as cooperative (different list in multiplayer lobby)

 - 	Few other options could be added (these are undecided yet, feel free to make 
	suggestions)
	MapDifficulty - default or restrictions or options ...
	Win/DefCond - custom text conditions for win/defeat
	PlayerColor - player color selector

MAP_NAME.dat notes

 - 	Map name specified in DAT file will be ignored by KaM Remake. Instead KaM Remake 
	will access MAP_NAME.map from the map folder
