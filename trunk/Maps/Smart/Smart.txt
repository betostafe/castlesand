This is no easy mission. However, it's very fun to play because the enemy will attack you by surprise and the attacks will vary a lot. If you can hold out against the first attack, it doesn't mean you will win the mission. That's what it makes so different from other missions/maps... If you somehow can save your ally from being destroyed, they will start attacking the enemy when they have an army that's large enough.
