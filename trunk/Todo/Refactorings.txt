Add seperate folder for SP maps that do not go into releases (MapsTest)

Tool that generates the Release folder and a Diff with new or modified files from the previous release folder
Implement real fog of war by combining layers and fow mask
Rework render layers so that cursor logic is in corresponding UI modules

Redesign gameplay UI into units similar to main menu pages
Introduce free-movement forms into MapEd interface (-> next item)
Redesign interface with focus on moveable forms instead of static left-side menu (so we can add more info)
Rework the way wares are stored in houses, allowing to evacuate and removing segregation to In and Out
Networking needs refactoring, maybe we can split it into common, lobby and gameplay parts
Replace indexing of terrain and net parts from 1..N to a convenient 0..N-1
