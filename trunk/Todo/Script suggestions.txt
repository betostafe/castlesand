Accepted:
	Closest house/unit/group to given XY of certain player and type
	Change house/unit/group owner
	AI equip rate
	Allow to query count of placed house plans
	States.HouseUnderAttack or OnHouseUnderAttack or similar (needed for Tower Defence)
	DisplayText(text, player_id, timeout) to show announcements that will be gone after timeout (for TD and etc.)
	Split a specific warrior out of a group
	Looping option for PlayWAV (useful for ambient sounds at a location)
	UnitKill should work for animals (doesn't work because they don't check fKillASAP during UpdateState)


Proposed:
	Change position/alignment/font of overlay text
	Render sprite onto map (from provided RXX file)
	Render sprite overlaid on the screen like TKMImage (from provided RXX file)

	Removing wares from houses (only if serfs haven't reserved them)
	DelayedExecution(delay, function, params)
	Forbiden areas where players can't move their troops
	GroupKillAll, GroupSetHunder (both can be implemented in script fairly easily, do we still provide them?)
	Way to add/remove recruits directly from barracks
	ChangeMapTile
	SetAIName
	OnUnitAttacked
	OnHouseAttacked
	More options for on-screen text (background color, alignment, font, size, etc.)
	States.PlayerIsAI(Index): Boolean;
	Actions.AddDefensePosition, RemDefensePosition
	States.HouseCanReachResources: boolean (for mines, fisher and woodcutters)
	OnHousePlanPut(aHouseID)
	HousePlanAt(X, Y), returns aPlanID.
	HousePlanType(aPlanID), returns the type of the house plan.
	OnRoadPlanPut(X,Y,Typ) (also with versions for fields and wine)
	States.GroupAtDefPos(PlayerID, PositionID)
	Actions.AddDefPos(PlayerID, UnitType, X, Y, facing direction, defence radius, frontline: boolean)
	Actions.RemDefPos(PlayerID, PositionID)
	Allow high volume boost for positional script sounds (currently limited to 1.0) since they are much quieter than non-positional sounds
	Add flag to allow to kill units with death animation, but without sound
