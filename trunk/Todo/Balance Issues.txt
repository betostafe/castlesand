=======================
Fixed in Scipting demo:
=======================
ISSUE: Axemen/swordsmen are not used because lancemen/pikemen are much cheaper and still good as a "meatshield" for archers. Knights/scouts are not used often because of high price (horses are slow)
SOLUTION: Units with shield (including knights/scouts) have +1 defence against archers

ISSUE: Bowmen are rarely used, crossbowmen are so much better.
SOLUTION: Decrease aiming pause for bowmen

ISSUE: Excess builders used to empty enemy towers.
SOLUTION: Make builders avoid enemy towers (as if they are scared to walk near it, cos they get killed)

ISSUE: Killing fleeing bowmen/crossbowmen is hard, even with knights, as they keep going away from the hits unless you flank/suround them.
SOLUTION: After warrior/group refactoring we made attack orders be followed through if the enemy steps away so they are pursued

ISSUE: Archers attacking houses can be exploited to skip their reload time if repeatedly repeating attack. It resets their animation and the house is destroyed nearly twice as fast. Can also be used against units.
SOLUTION: Remember the last time we shot and add a pause before shooting if it was too recently


=====================
Fixed in 5th MP demo:
=====================
ISSUE: Making food was mostly not necessary.
SOLUTION: Measure unit initial hunger level from TPR and reset it to that.

ISSUE: Wine was not useful, other food types were much better
SOLUTION: Change restore from 20% -> 30%, fields required from 11 -> 9.


=====================
Pending
=====================
ISSUE:
Storm attack is not practical, especially in MP with lag delays
SOLUTION: Units start running immediately and travel a more consistent (less random) distance
SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS:
 1. Make storm attack last longer and be easier to aim (tell them where to storm to, rather than clicking button at the right moment)
    + Works well even with high network lag, storm becomes like a special move instruction, where each unit faces that direction (closest) and storms.


ISSUE:
Tower spam might be overpowered, needs more evidence.
SOLUTIONS:
 1. Allow host to select maximum number of towers per player
    + Players can choose to play in the style they want to, no game style is excluded.
    - Unnatural/doesn't fit with KaM (other houses/units don't have artifical limits)
    - Divides community further over what "true KaM gameplay" is
 2. Make towers less accurate like they were in r3392
    - Towers become basically useless, no way to protect yourself and have sieges. Games finish 10 min after PT ends.
 3. Make towers easier to destoy (reduce hp by half)
    - decent defence will require even more towers placed
    - Without reducing the cost it will be non-consistent with other houses (50hp per 1 building material)
 4. Bring back siege equipment with a bonus against houses or able to attack houses only
    + Good use for siege equipment


ISSUE:
A player who uses the market will beat an equal player who doesn't use the market. I'd rather the market be a strategic choice not "the only way to victory".
SOLUTIONS:
 1. Make costs higher so it's less abusable, especially good trades are coal/iron/gold/tree trunks
    + We can target resources that are being abused in trading while still keeping good prices for other resources
    - Might not solve the problem unless costs are fairly high, since coal/gold/iron are effectively unlimited on most maps because games only last 2 hours max.
 2. Make value of resources increase as you buy them and decrease as you sell them, Age of Empires style
    - That just makes the market more useful at the start and less useful at the end
    - Age of Empires has 4 resources, KaM has 27, so it's not really comparable
 3. Remove the market's current function, make it only for trading player to player
    - The current function is useful, many players like it
    - Current market is useful for emergency situations, makes the game more accessible/forgiving to mistakes like running out of gold
    + We don't have to make/find graphics for the planned "Trading Post" for this purpose
    + The Dark Lord will be eternally grateful xD
 4. Recalculate market prices with regard to time it takes to get first ware (e.g. time in minutes it takes to get first ware in normal way).
    + Horses, Pigs and their subproducts will become more expensive, thus discouraging trading of "fast" resources (coal, stone) for Horses, Sausages, etc..


ISSUE:
Builder rushes when enemy spams builders and covers whole map in its houseplans.
