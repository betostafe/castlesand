Ideas that have not been decided. Should be moved to Bugslist.txt when a decision is made
We can discuss them in dialog-style and maybe move to GC issues later on
<===================================================================================>
	L	Show the mining radius of the selected house or house that you are placing
			Krom: Idea is okay. We need to display mining "strength" (think coalmine) as well, in some nice way, also show ranges of all houses of the same king to allow player to plan his mining better (e.g. avoid overlaps). Iron/Gold don't need this mostly, but Coal/Fish/Towers - do.
			Krom: Another note - mining radies should show effective range with regard to walking legth.
			Lewin: Yes showing walking length shouldn't be a problem, we can use GetTilesWithinDistance and highlight the returned tiles. We'll need to "cache" the list so we don't call GetTilesWithinDistance every time we paint (or maybe 1-2ms doesn't matter so much?)
	L	Gameplay mutators in multiplayer: no iron, no archers, no market, no towers, etc. Host can select multiple mutators.
	L	People can cheat in MP during peacetime by digging a house/road over an enemy road or free land (block houses on enemy territory during peacetime?)
			Krom: Easiest implementation seems to be floodfill from towns until areas make borders
			Lewin: Agreed.
	L	AI warriors should automatically engage enemies within 3-4 tiles (happens in KaM?)
			Krom: 2 tiles seems quite enough to me
	L	Split network protocol (commands) into server-client level (queries, rooms, connecting, disconnecting) and game level (lobby, gameplay) [Lewin]
			Relates to security and futureproofing
	L	When player leaves allow his allies to take control over his village and army
	L	Make lobby flag selection using list of countries that speak that language. With English you could choose USA, UK, AU, NZ. With Spanish you could choose Spain, Argentina, Chille.
			Lewin: Sounds ok. Means we need to include ~200 flags I guess, but with RXX packing that's no big problem.
			Krom: Flag represents locale, language that the player can read/type, not an actual location.
			Lewin: The problem is languages don't have flags, countries do. The best we can do is use the country of origin for the flag (e.g. Spain not Argentina, UK not US) Although people use the flag to assume where you are from.
	L	Add a button into MapEd to allow quickplay the map
	L	Change army counts in charts and statistics to army power (e.g. knights worth more than militia)
	L	Allow dedicated server host to do announcements (e.g. server will be closed in 5min, plz save and quit)
	L	Add shortcut keys to common messsages in MP (defend here, attack, check ur base, etc.)

		Warriors should remember their last attack order after a fight "ends", so if you ask cavalry to attack archers they do not stop and stand still as soon as the first one dies because the others are not within direct reach. Probably all orders should be remembered and resumed after a fight, so if you ask a warrior to move somewhere and he bumps into a bowman, after killing him he should continue on his way.
		Aggressive/defensive stances for soldiers, so they will attack a unit within a few tiles in aggressive mode and only start shooting when the enemy is close in defensive mode
	L	Add a "seperate one unit from the group" button for scouting etc. (we can rearrange interface due to unused move/attack buttons)
	L	Add a way to feed only <30% hungry units
		Switch beacon from B to more convenient Alt+Click as in other RTS?

		In-game player list should show who is defeated (shown seperately to who is disconnected which is already shown by strikethrough)
		Allow to build fields over winefields, allow to destruct own fields and roads by workers.
		KaM Launcher that will do automatic game client updates
		Allow to mute certain players in lobby/game
			Krom: Sounds like half-measure against trolls
		Add "plant-only" option to the woodcutter, useful if the woodcutter has some trees but you don't need them cut yet, also for getting your woodcutters in different phases so they are not all choppping/planting in sync (less efficient)
		Display in MP players list who was defeated (with a new icon?)
		Fix fences shading along edges of FOW
		Experiment with adding new terrain objects (Pawel's dandelion, unused sprite in Trees.rx). I think there are currently less than 255 objects so maybe we can just insert them in some of the free slots?
		Clicking on allied soldiers shows a button that enables one to feed his ally's
		Ability to set your default color next to your name on MP page (it will be selected in the lobby if available)
		A way to assign locations to random people within a team (e.g. random 1,2,3,4 vs random 5,6,7,8). Most maps require specific team layouts so random locations are not used.
		Allow saving from within replays. This would let you create a save of a game at a certain moment and continue playing from there, which could be good for practice (e.g. town building) or fun.
		A way to order +100 weapons at weapon makers (shift + click?)
		Invisible links between water bodies to connect water under bridges


REJECTED:
 -	Archers on a hill get slightly longer range (calculated from height of archer tile relative to target tile)
		not sure about this one. Probably ruins balance and feel of KaM
 -	Try extending height to 0..255 rather than 0..100 so it's easier to have multiple "levels" on a map (e.g. plateau with a hill on it)
		Krom: I disagree. This is not as simple as a matter of just extending it. We need to discuss
 -	Do not send a Recruit to WatchTower when Player has built it but did not connected it with road
		Krom: I think that makes good sense. But if Player made 10 towers and 10 recruits and only then connected them with roads - will/should recruits walk from Barracks to Towers?
		Lewin: The only case this can happen is when the player starts with the towers right? You can't build a house without connecting it to road. I think it's ok for the recruits to go to the towers, but stones definitely should not.
		Rejection reason: Map maker can fill towers with rocks at the start, so recruits are useful
 -	Separate crash situations into gameplay (stop the game because recovery is impossible due to wrongful game state after unfinished UpdateState) and UI (where recovery is much more likely)
 -	Value of resources at the market increases as you buy them and decreases as you sell them to prevent exploiting? (Age of Empires style)
		Lewin: With peacetime of at least 1 hour I haven't heard of market exploits being more profitable than normal play
		Krom: I think our prices are good as they are (just add some tweaks to bread/sausages cost)
 -	Add soldiers counts to statistics page in game (take icons from MapEd)
		Krom: That could be too much detail without real need
 -	Add fan-made section where fans could add LOLCat, Welsh, Simple English, Funny and other translations with fallback to existing locale
 - 	Select multiple saves at once to be deleted (click+drag or hold shift/ctrl)
