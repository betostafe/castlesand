Features:
 +	MP game speed up slider (x1, x1.5, x2, x2.5, x3)
 +	Coop maps handled better in lobby (AI players hidden and automatic, AI map areas not revealed)
 +	Host can set password for lobby
 +	Army graph starts 5% before the first variation (to skip peacetime)
 +	Lobby name/description by host (shown in room info and inside the room as 1st message)
 +	Replace in-game "team only" checkbox with button with "All, Team, <Player Name>". Clicking it brings up menu to select recipient.
 +	Improved players color saturation and unified sprites import/export
 +	Kick dropdown when clicking on player flag in lobby and disable console cmds for now (could be added later for "/cheats 1" and similar)
	Swap players/resources in graphs? (so you compare "who made the most wood?" rather than "did Lewin make more stone than wood?") [Lewin]


Finishing up:
 +	Message log
 +	Finish new MapEd features (add ADD_WARE_TO_LAST)
 +	SP maps list will keep jumping to the top while items are being added (you can't scroll down until scanning is done)
 +	Example maps that show what can be done with new scripts (more can be added later)
 +	Decide which script commands will be implemented for this release and implement them (can add more as requested)
 +	Lock icon next to password protected servers
 +	Finish AI stuff (defending and attacking prototype?)
 +	Performance test city builder and optimise/fix slow stuff (NextToOre using FindNearest for example)
	Snow houses artwork [KillingB]
	Snow house overlay fixes [KillingB, Krom]
	Improve snow falling random noise so it looks more natural [Krom]
	Remove falling trees from MapEd trees palette
	Before RC search for all todos and @Lewin/@Krom comments to see if there's something important we forgot about
	Before RC remove unused strings from LIBX (Lewin: I have code that lists unused strings; Krom: should be in TransMan perhaps; Lewin: Done) and compact indexes
	Press release for our site where we collect all the big features and improvements [Lewin]


Known issues to fix:
 +	MP maps are still using auto generated goals. Do we keep it like that? Yes, but "Special" maps don't have auto goals so scripts can customise it
 +	Campaign/tutorials show warnings about showing messages with goals being depreciated, make tool to fix them [Krom]
 +	Fix "Vortamic" and "On the Way" texts (need to get texts 560..564) [Lewin]
	Copy data\sfx\knights\battle4.wav to Polish sfx (horse sound Pol is missing) [Lewin]
	ALL MP maps will need SET_USER_PLAYER set for them, since when maps were made with Lewin's editor all locations are AI except the first one. Make a tool to fix this and publish memo about "fixing" maps made in other editors [Krom]
	TSK campaign fixes by BornFree, check they all make sense [Lewin]


After first RC:
	Ask RC testers to make map from scratch in MapEd
	Magic water in MapEd?
	Check main menu / gameplay interfaces for text that needs to be added to the LIBX (e.g. lobby speed)
	Add missing texts from MapEd to LIBX (maybe ignore some stuff in temporary interfaces that will be improved next release?)
	Send text off to be translated (do this late in the RC testing so translators don't get 3 separate requests for each RC with changed text)
	Performance test the replay of a full MP game to check for chokepoints in a real-world scenario
	Press release?


Balance/exploits:
 +	Increased market loss ratio to 2.2
 +	Tested: 4 farms (with unsown fields) + 2 stables beats 6 woodcutters (with 5 grown trees each) + 1 market in horse production by 16% (20 mins), 30% (30 mins), 45% (40 mins), 77% (60 mins)
	Stop builders emptying towers (builders refuse to walk into range of a tower or player blocked from building there?)


Not for this release, maybe next time:
	Pawel's flower
	Increase player limit to 10?
	File transfers
