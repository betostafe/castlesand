0:The village in the north hath declared openly against further tyranny. Thou shouldst turn this to thine own advantage.
1:Our faithful scouts have discovered a deserted storehouse. It lieth to the west, nigh to a small wood. Surely there wilt thou find items of use to thee.
2:An enemy scout hath been captured and interrogated. It doth appear that the enemy hath discovered our position and even now prepareth an attack against thee.
