0:Our allies hand over several units under your command. We need to stop the march of the enemy, then take over the city, gain access to local resources, and gain some space for expansion. To battle!
1:Remember that we do not need to destroy the Capital. You can use local fields and vineyards because the stocks in our storehouse are very limited. The enemy retreated to the castle so we will be forced to attack it as long as necessary.
2:Our scouts think that outside the castle are military supply points. Track and then destroy them in order to stop the flow of raw materials to the castle. Perhaps we can starve the enemy troops and force them to surrender without fighting.
3:We have just received information that the powerful forces will attack us at any moment. To arms!
