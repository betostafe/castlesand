0:Our allies hand over several units under your command. We need to stop the march of the enemy. Then we need to gain access to local resources and gain some space for expansion. To battle!
1:Remember that we don't need to destroy the Capital. You can use local fields and vineyards because our stocks in storehouse is very limited. The enemy hid in the castle so we will be forced to attack it as long as necessary.
2:Our scouts think that outside the castle are military supply points. Track and then destroy them in order to stop the flow of raw materials to the castle. Maybe we can starve the enemy troops and forced to surrender without fighting.
3:We have just received information that the powerful forces will attack us at any moment. To arms!
