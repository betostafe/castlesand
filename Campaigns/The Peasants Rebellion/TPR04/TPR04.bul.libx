0:Our scouts report that thy enemy hath enslaved most of thine citizens in the area. Storm their defenses but destroy only their military buildings, leaving thine enslaved settlers unharmed. This shouldst surely send thy enemy into glorious retreat and free thy citizens!
1:I stress upon thee, protect thine allied troops to the south from thy enemy attacks!|Allow them not to fall prey to thy opponent, for we need their support more than ever.
