0:We have arrived at the final stronghold of the treacherous rebels.|Thou shalt slay all of the rebellious and caddish dwellers here, leaving not a single breathing soul after this glorious battle hath come to an end!
1:Our spies report that our enemy hath indeed discovered our new location and now prepareth an attack against thee.|Unsheath thy trusty sword once more and give no quarter to these ruthless rebels!
