10:              Mission 1||The renegades are trying to oppress the few farmers who remain loyal to the kingdom. Outside the king's palace, innocent farmers are being butchered, and under no circumstances can you allow this!|Force the attackers into retreat!
11:              Mission 2||After our successful support of the farmers, we must free the remaining farmers. A large enemy is coming directly towards us from the north.|Into battle!
12:              Mission 3||After the victorious battle you now have some time to rebuild the ruined towns and villages and to secure supplies to your subjects. Then you should turn your attention to liberating the occupied settlements in the north and fight the tyrannical rule of the renegade aristocracy. Spare the civilian country folk and fight only the enemy soldiers who are stationed there.
13:              Mission 4||Our spies have seen enemy troop maneuvers in the surrounding settlements. Due to the high number of enemy soldiers, we must presume that they have a fortified camp. Find and destroy it, including all enemy military buildings.
14:              Mission 5||Now, after your overwhelming success in the fight against the rebels, we must reckon with a massive counterattack. Prepare your people for a hard fight. Prevent the villages from being destroyed.
15:              Mission 6||We know that our enemy is building new bases. You cannot permit this. Attack as soon as possible, before the enemy has recovered.|Also search the area for raw materials, because your supplies of iron ore are almost exhausted.
16:              Mission 7||Before we turn again to the rebels, we must win back the settlements in the south. The victory in the last battle brought us a small quantity of iron that we urgently need. But because iron deposits in this area are very limited, we must be very careful how we use it.
17:              Mission 8||During our last attack we had to move most of our people away from our base and have given the enemy a chance to attack. Return as quickly as possible, before the foe can overrun our defenses!
18:              Mission 9||Because of the ambush we have not been able to reach the castle in time. We need to come up with a good strategy to reconquer what is ours. The main gate is heavily defended, and a direct attack would be useless. Try to attack another entrance and avoid casualties, as we have no possibility to mine for more iron ore.
19:              Mission 10||Through reconquering the castle, we have made some prisoners, who have told us about an underground tunnel, that leads through the northern mountains. The entrance to the tunnel is being guarded by a few enemy soldiers. Overthrow the guards and enter the tunnel.
20:              Mission 11||The cave is bigger than expected. Our scouts have discovered enemy guards in the winding tunnels, who are protecting the underground complex from intruders. Reach the exit on the other side of the mountains.
21:              Mission 12||The opposing troops have been informed of our intentions. Strong enemy battalions are advancing and will soon attack. Build towers to weaken the coming troops. When the defense has been successful, you will be able to cross the pass to the north.
22:              Mission 13||An ambush! Our enemy has been waiting for us. We are now in an extremely bad position. Force the insidious bandits into retreat!
23:              Mission 14||We have arrived at last bastion of our enemy. They have brought the rest of their armies together and barricaded themselves into their final retreat, northeast from here. Due to the freezing cold, the river is partly frozen, and offers us a possibility of surprising our opposition. Defeat the remaining enemy troops, so that peace can return to our land!
