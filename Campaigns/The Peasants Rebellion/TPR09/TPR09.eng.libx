0:To support thy army, thou shouldst need hire more mercenaries from the town hall. These seditious soldiers will strengthen thine army and help thee repel thy enemy.
1:Perchance if thou shouldst try the back entrance, thou mayst find it unguarded. With this advantage thou shouldst surely defeat thine enemy with ease.
