I've named it All for One for a reason. The player on the front needs to be protected on both wings by his teammates who have a supportive role to play here. If one of them can't defend the player on the front he will be outflanked and can be defeated too easely. Just because he has too much space to defend all by himself. In other words, teamwork is even more important on this map.||Made by To.
