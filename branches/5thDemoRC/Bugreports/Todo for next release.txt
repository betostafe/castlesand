=============
Must be done:
=============
 +	Campaign editor tool for the public [Krom]
 +	Remove redundant word-wrapping ("|") from unit descriptions for all languages. Keep the intentional ones that break it into paragraphs. [Lewin]
 +	Statistics page in game in replay should show stats from the last player you selected [Krom]
 +	Fix TSK 19 crash [Lewin]
 +	Update game files from SR3 where approperiate [Lewin]
 +	Test all campaign missions for minor script warnings and fix them (e.g. TSK 7) [Lewin]
 +	Narrator in campaign breifings [Lewin]
 +	Finish custom campaign support
 +	Add new music tracks Market and Household
 +	Block market in original missions through script not code hack [Lewin]
 +	Fixed TKMCityPlanner.NextToTrees (broken during FindTree refactoring)
 +	Alerts on the minimap when a unit/house is under attack
 +	Multiplayer should have an option to send a flare (beacon) on the minimap to tell allies (or all players) about something.
 +	Update readme with changed info (shortcuts)
 +	Finish charts [Lewin]
	Add new maps and maybe delete some existing ones based on quality and popularity
 -	Check if we can use smoothing when scaling menu images up/down [Krom] (can't be done without adding mipmaps and that will bloat textures size by 1/3)


==============================
Could be done if we have time:
==============================
 +	Allow to assign groups and houses(!) to Ctrl+0..9 keys
 +	Selecting a map in multiplayer should show columns with name, size, player count, etc. rather than dumb drop down
 +	Attacking a house from the bottom right, soldiers will stack up rather than choosing a different free cell (WalkToHouse should avoid other units attacking the house?)
 +	If a woodcutter plants a tree where you placed a building site, the site gets canceled (very annoying) due to AbandonWalk and conditions for multiple players building on a tile
 +	Duplicate app blocking should happen for multiplayer mode only (including replays) as that's the only cheating we care about
 +	Show peacetime remaining in MP replays
	Translation manager should have an option to only show certain languages, e.g. DE translator can select just DE and EN rather than scrolling through all of them
	Place all the roads for all players, then all the houses for all players, then all the units for all players from the script, repositioning units that are on houses and do floodfill for houses once at the end rather than for each house
