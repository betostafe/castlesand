Todo:
	Customising anti-aliasing settings (and others?) in AMD's Catalyst Control Center causes houses to not render on HD5770 (pawel95 on forum). Maybe that's normal?
	Assertion failed with serf trying to remove 1 resource from a storehouse with none of that resource in stock (crash reports on 8th September)
	Wooden house frames flicking on Onboard Intel HD Family Chipset (see images "Hidden House Frame Intel Onboard 1.jpg")
 -	AI soldiers will shoot at enemies during PT in MP game. That's normal, peacetime does not disable fighting, it disables troop control so you can't move/train troops and the AI will not train troops, move troops, attack, etc. If you build roads in front of enemy archers, yes they will shoot you, that's a feature not a bug.


Fixed in 4th RC r3985:
 +	Crash when selecting a high refresh rate then selecting a resolution that only supports lower refresh rates
 +	"Digging field" and "Constructing winefield" activity text was swapped
 +	Dragging above/below a column list would select items out of sight
 +	Ask Ukr translator (Mulberry) to fix his translations and use "Kazarmy" instead of "Baraki", cos latter is a wrong term.
 +	Player with an unknown (custom) locale code would crash the lobby for everyone when trying to display their flag
 +	Exception/crash report window now shows the exception message to the user
 +	Players can insert illegal characters (according to fAllowedChars) into edits with copy/paste from another program
 +	Armour smithy has shields as 2nd ouput, armour workshop has shields as 1st output. Would make sense to match them
 +	Armour smithy has iron as 1st input, weapon smithy has iron as 2nd input (iron/coal swapped). Would make sense to match them
 +	Added Belarusian translation
 +	So far 4 beta testers report they have old PCs with OpenGL 1.3 and now can't play the Remake. Maybe we can use legacy terrain rendering without VBOs for people with old OpenGL versions? 4/80+ beta testers is not insignificant.
 +	Using 3D mode allows you to see through fog of war
 +	On The Cracked Land the stone mountain for loc 7 was too elevated and usually could not be completely mined
 +	The elevation features of the map editor now work more like Krom's editor (it's still not finished, but more usable)
 +	Game could still crash when toggling locale if you did not have OpenAL installed


Fixed in 3rd RC r3967:
 +	Viewport position was not saved with MP map properly
 +	Hotkeys were not saved in SP games
 +	Make MapEd to start with default 30% height
 +	Map Winter Comes does not have !CENTER_SCREEN commands so the locations are not shown the lobby
 +	CRC check was flawed, CRC check needs to be based on what we loaded at game start, not what is on the user's HDD at the time he joins the lobby
 +	Enforce tiles triangulation direction to NW-SE
 +	Tweak AI to food balance changes
 +	Improve unit task display
 +	Resource sliders always unlocked at start when house will become buildable (blocked houses still disabled)
 +	New default for resource sliders
 +	Enemy stonemason in TSK 11 will not cut through the mountain below the player because of walking distance check going around his house (increased mining radius by +2)
 +	CTRL+B to place beacon while chat window is open (CTRL also works for other shortcuts like troops)
 +	Fix smooth shadows from the mill blades, they don't use pure black so the shadow smoothing algorithm ignores them
 +	Fixed crash when using extreme zoom in MapEd/Game with onScreenDisplays turned on (deposit amounts, teamnames)
 +	Crash when having the Remake on 2nd monitor on right, when moving your cursor to the left monitor (Shadaoe to confirm fix)
 +	Crash when starting a map from the lobby if the script contained a fatal error (it should just show the normal error screen)
 +	Crash on startup for some people where the game tried to unnecessarily obtain read+write (not just read) access for data\defines\pattern.dat
 +	Include dat files CRC in saves and don't load a different CRC save (show the user an error)
 +	All multiplayer maps need more starting food due to matching unit condition to original KaM


Fixed in 2nd RC r3870:
 +	Received a packet not intended for this state mk_GameCRC every time another player joins the lobby
 +	Wrong hint for replay_pause button
 +	Crash when using MapEd unequalize right click just above the top row of the map
 +	Crash in KMGetDirection called from SetActionFight from TUnitActionWalkTo.Execute. See crash report email on 18/08/12. (possible cause: attacking an enemy that appears to be too close to you so KMGetDirection fails?)
 +	Beacon cursor is invisible in full screen mode and on certain computers. It looks like Windows prefers cursors no more than 64x64 pixels according to internet so I trimmed it down a bit, still looks ok and bug seems to be fixed, at least for me.
 +	If you load a game and save it there's no .bas file so you can't replay it
 +	TSK 3 AI troops are less than willing to attack players forces
 +	Lag in multiplayer, tiny pauses between each game tick that gave the game an unpleasent feeling (adjusted delay)
 +	Tweak food values in market so most valuable foods are worth more
 +	When pressing ALT+F4 from full screen the "Are you sure you want to exit?" dialog is stuck behind the game window, fixed with a hacky solution for now
 +	People press F12 by accident and enable UI overlays, now the shortcut only works if DEBUG_CHEATS are enabled
 +	Water shadows are too dark
 +	Rebalanced wine, now restores 30% (was 20%) and takes 9 fields to run optimally (was 11) through changed growth rate
