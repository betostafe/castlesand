Todo:
 +	Received a packet not intended for this state mk_GameCRC every time another player joins the lobby
 +	Wrong hint for replay_pause button
	Enforce tiles triangulation direction to NW-SE
	Crash in KMGetDirection called from SetActionFight from TUnitActionWalkTo.Execute. See crash report email on 18/08/12. (possible cause: attacking an enemy that appears to be too close to you so KMGetDirection fails?)
	Map Winter Comes does not have !CENTER_SCREEN commands so the locations are not shown the lobby (check other maps by HellRacer too)
 -	AI soldiers will shoot at enemies during PT in MP game. That's normal, peacetime does not disable fighting, it disables troop control so you can't move/train troops and the AI will not train troops, move troops, attack, etc. If you build roads in front of enemy archers, yes they will shoot you, that's a feature not a bug.
