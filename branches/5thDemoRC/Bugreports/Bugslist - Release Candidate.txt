Todo:
 +	Received a packet not intended for this state mk_GameCRC every time another player joins the lobby
 +	Wrong hint for replay_pause button
 +	Crash when using MapEd unequalize right click just above the top row of the map
 +	Crash in KMGetDirection called from SetActionFight from TUnitActionWalkTo.Execute. See crash report email on 18/08/12. (possible cause: attacking an enemy that appears to be too close to you so KMGetDirection fails?)
 +	Beacon cursor is invisible in full screen mode and on certain computers. It looks like Windows prefers cursors no more than 64x64 pixels according to internet so I trimmed it down a bit, still looks ok and bug seems to be fixed, at least for me.
 +	If you load a game and save it there's no .bas file so you can't replay it
 +	TSK 3 AI troops are less than willing to attack players forces
 +	Lag in multiplayer, tiny pauses between each game tick that gave the game an unpleasent feeling (adjusted delay)
 +	Tweak food values in market so most valuable foods are worth more
 +	When pressing ALT+F4 from full screen the "Are you sure you want to exit?" dialog is stuck behind the game window, fixed with a hacky solution for now
 +	People press F12 by accident and enable UI overlays, now the shortcut only works if DEBUG_CHEATS are enabled
 +	Water shadows are too dark
	Enforce tiles triangulation direction to NW-SE
	Map Winter Comes does not have !CENTER_SCREEN commands so the locations are not shown the lobby (check other maps by HellRacer too)
	All multiplayer maps need more starting food due to matching unit condition to original KaM
	Ask Ukr translator (Mulberry) to fix his translations and use "Kazarmy" instead of "Baraki", cos latter is a wrong term.
 -	AI soldiers will shoot at enemies during PT in MP game. That's normal, peacetime does not disable fighting, it disables troop control so you can't move/train troops and the AI will not train troops, move troops, attack, etc. If you build roads in front of enemy archers, yes they will shoot you, that's a feature not a bug.
