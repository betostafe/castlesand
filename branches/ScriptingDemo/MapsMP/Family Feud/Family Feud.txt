With the founding of the kingdom, our great grandfather planted the sacred tree on the solitary peak. The tree grew together with the prosperous realm under wise rule of your family. But all good things come to an end, with the King's death, all of his quadruplet sons claim the crown for their own. Together with the suffering and divided kingdom, the sacred tree lost its green leaves and withered. It is said that only under the rule of the rightful heir will it flourish again. And so, here we are, 4 brothers at teach other's throats, and an old tree to decide who is worthy to wear the crown.||Made by Menszu.
