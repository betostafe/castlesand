==============
 SINCE r3374:
==============
 +	Access Violation in TPR3 after 0:01:40 due to an error in the script
 +	Enforced a minimum dedicated server announce interval of 3 minutes to stop people spamming our server every 30 seconds
 +	Range check error at the moment a multiplayer game starts (rare)

	In full screen: press Alt-F4, click no, press Alt-F4 again. This time message box goes under game window.

 ?	Kicked when the host selects a map you don't have
 ?	"Call to OS function failed" if you sleep the computer with KaM running
 ?	Access violation when clicking start in lobby (after reassigning host?)


==============
FIXED IN r3374
==============
 +	We are now using MadExcept to report crashes. When an error occurs you can send a highly detailed crash report to us.
 +	Crash "GameWaitingForNetwork from wrong state lgs_None" if you quit a multiplayer game while waiting for players and start a single player game
 +	All players reported the map being played to the master server, it should have only been the host
 +	PC icon was not shown as the flag for AI players in-game (only in lobby)
 +	Rare range check error when equipping a soldier due to dead recruit in the barracks
 +	Range check error due to projectiles landing off map (happens in Another Day in Hell around 2 minutes)
 +	"Assertion Failed, KM_CommonClasses.pas, line 349" caused by duplicate points in walking NodeList (rare)


==============
FIXED IN r3311
==============
 +	Some text IDs were duplicate so the text "Switch delivery of wares on/off" showed "Cost:" instead
 +	Screenshot button in menu didn't work
 +	Don't log form resizing
 +	Can't win campaign missions
 +	Blocked stonemason and released woodcutter on the map Europe, there is no stone on the map and you start with 1500
 +	Elevating in the map editor in non-square maps was buggy
 +	Removed two fan-made maps with terrain which has been partially copied from the original campaigns, we don't accept copy-paste maps
 +	Block icons when building a house near the left/top edge of the map are now rendered in the correct position
 +	"Duplicate points in list" error in multiplayer sometimes when placing a road, deleting it and placing it again
 +	Crash with "range check error" when a woodcutter tried to chop a tree near the bottom of the map
 +	Host does setup didn't reset to false if you created a new lobby, it used the value from the last lobby
 +	Focus in the chat edit in the lobby is lost when you use a drop down
 +	If the host selects a map/save you don't have (or have a different version) the lobby freezes
 +	Crash when starting if there is a closed slot above the host (due to host being reassigned)
 +	Units/trees on the edge of the map were rendered dark
 +	If a armour workshop ordered to produce shields and armour ran out of wood they would not produce armour
 +	If you try to build a mine with road being built underneth, it would show that you can't build it even though you could
 +	When installed to Program Files you no longer need administrator rights to run the game
 +	Host was never able to drop players who had disconnected, even after the 30 seconds (button stayed disabled)
 +	Join button on the multiplayer page would sometimes be enabled at the wrong times meaning you could click twice and cause a crash
 +	Double clicking in empty space on the server list would make you join the selected server
 +	Multiplayer saves were often created differently between computers
 +	It was often possible to place plans over your ally's plans, which caused a crash
 +	If two enemies placed plans over each other's, it would crash the replay
 +	Restored 4P versions of Border Rivers, Wilderness and Stranded so you can play 4P FFA with random starts
