A mission by The Dark Lord

BigDesc
Every place in Farler's kingdom is peaceful, except one region. The border between two provinces. Baron Grullheimer (brown) and Count Yata (green) have been in war for years. They dispose of each other. King Farler wants to put an end to this bloody war, and that's why he has sent you to the cold and icy border.||You will be given 15 pikemen, 9 crossbowmen, 10 knights and 3 labourers to complete your first task. Your first task is to destroy two barracks. One of the Count, in the south-west, and one in the centre, which belongs to the Baron. When the barracks has been destroyed, our first step to peace is set. Remember that you have been sent to make peace, so do not kill any citizens. After that is done, accompany the labourers to the storehouse in the east.||For your second task, you will need the storehouse, together with the wares in it, the 4 servants, the 3 labourers and your remaining soldiers. Build a base, train as many soldiers as you need, and destroy the other two barracks. Those two are much better defended, so be on your guard. Because the northern villages are significantly more powerful, you have to destroy the storehouses and schoolhouses as well. Otherwise, Baron Grullheimer and Count Yata might find other ways to fight each other.||Good luck commander.
