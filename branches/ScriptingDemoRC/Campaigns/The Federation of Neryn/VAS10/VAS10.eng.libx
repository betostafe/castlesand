0:Our cavalry tries an attack hoping to break their defence. If they fail, you will be on your own until further troops arrive.
1:The enemies are recruiting new warriors very quickly. You should counter with new attacks immediately.
2:Reinforcements have arrived! The Aalenburg sent some of their soldiers to conduct another attack. If you can spare additional troops, participation in the battle would be wise.
3:This was the first chapter of my campaign. I hope you enjoyed it.
4:Extensions will follow sometime in the future.
5:Please mail me your feedback of the last ten missions,
6:whether you found any mistakes and how
