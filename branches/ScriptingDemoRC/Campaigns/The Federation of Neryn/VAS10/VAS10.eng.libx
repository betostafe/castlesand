0:Our cavalry tries an attack hoping to break their defence. If they fail, you will be on your own until further troops arrive.
1:The enemies are recruiting new warriors very quickly. You should counter with new attacks immediately.
2:Reinforcements have arrived! The Aalenburg sent some of their soldiers to conduct another attack. If you can spare additional troops, participation in the battle would be wise.
3:This was the first chapter of my campaign. I hope you enjoyed it.|Extensions will follow sometime in the future.|Please mail me your feedback of the last 10 missions,|whether you found any mistakes and how difficult it was|and send me your replays to vas.kam@gmx.de
