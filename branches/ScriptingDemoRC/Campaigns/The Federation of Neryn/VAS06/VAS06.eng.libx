1:Our troops reached the island.|Hold position! They will try to prevent your settlement for certain.
2:The enemy patrol holds our ally at bay. Your first target is the annihilation of this patrol troop. The sooner you carry that out the better. It is highly likely that the nomads will reinforce their troops.
3:You liberated Angersheim. The inhabitants will do their best to support us. Lookout for enemy troops, our opponents won't be amused by these latest developments.
4:The stone mountain will be depleted very soon, so that you can extend your fulcrum to the south. Use the western coal seams to support your gold production. Nevertheless, take care that you do not hinder Angersheim extending its town.
