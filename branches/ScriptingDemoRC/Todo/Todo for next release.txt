=============
Since 1st RC:
=============

Bugs:
 +	Pathfinding bug causing units to zigzag a bit when they should be walking straight
 +	Annie's hill/garden can be won with labourers. Only soldiers should count for capturing.
 +	Removing house plan in MP could rarely cause a crash
 +	Navigating with arrows in serverlist was not available (regress from r4179)
	Randomize locations within teams checkbox should only be enabled for host
	Chat/allies/message log panels block clicks on map to the right of them (check in MapEd too)
	Crash using terrain brush in sado's map (emailed to us)
	Kicking also kicks the host (Linux server only?)
	"Should match with HitTest that selected this group" when selecting a unit (MouseUp)
	Message log should be hidden until the 1st message arrives, looks odd to have a blank scroll
	Can only place buildings for one player in SP MapEd, for others its just red crosses.
	Dragging brush in MapEd over minimap should not trigger minimap position change
	Gamespeed cant be set anymore for coop games
	we had a match on "Coastal Encounter Score" with 2 humans and 1 AI. One human lost all of his troops first. The moment his last fighter died, the server disconnected him.
	Changing terrain in MapEd from snow to non-snow should update snowed houses placed there
	Teams show wrong in lobby (should use player locs instead of player slots)
	Archers are much less responsive in MP (due to finishing attack sequence to prevent exploit)


Finishing up:
	Snow houses artwork [KillingB]
	Snow house overlay fixes [KillingB, Krom]


After first RC:
	Ask RC testers to make map from scratch in MapEd
	Magic water in MapEd?
	Check main menu / gameplay interfaces for text that needs to be added to the LIBX (e.g. lobby speed)
	Add missing texts from MapEd to LIBX (maybe ignore some stuff in temporary interfaces that will be improved next release?)
	Send text off to be translated (do this late in the RC testing so translators don't get 3 separate requests for each RC with changed text)
	Ask translators to shorten up messages that we show in message log (empty house, feed troops, etc)
	Performance test the replay of a full MP game to check for chokepoints in a real-world scenario
	Press release?
	Decided what to do about proportional/exact weapons production (hybrid solution?)
	Dynamic script commands: Silent kill unit (no death animation, allows changing farmers to rebels), get/set ware distribution, get/set store/barracks delivery block flags, CoverCircle (opposite to reveal circle), ClosestUnit/House/Group(X,Y,Player), center screen, select unit/group/house in player's UI, SetWoodCutterMode, AI recruits in barracks (lets you disable/enable AI soldier equipping), equip rate
	DAT script commands: Storehouse/barrack block flags, disable ally fog sharing
	Write Lazarus network wrapper using base FPC sockets and see if it's more stable than LNet
	TSK campaign fixes by BornFree (especially faster equip rate), if he fixes issues with food


Maps:
	Circus? (thunder)
	Dead Rivers? (thunder)
	Frozen waters? (sado)
	Border Rivers fix by Thunder?


================
Fixed in 1st RC:
================

Features:
 +	MP game speed up slider (x1, x1.5, x2, x2.5, x3)
 +	Coop maps handled better in lobby (AI players hidden and automatic, AI map areas not revealed)
 +	Host can set password for lobby
 +	Army graph starts 5% before the first variation (to skip peacetime)
 +	Lobby name/description by host (shown in room info and inside the room as 1st message)
 +	Replace in-game "team only" checkbox with button with "All, Team, <Player Name>". Clicking it brings up menu to select recipient.
 +	Improved players color saturation and unified sprites import/export
 +	Kick dropdown when clicking on player flag in lobby and disable console cmds for now (could be added later for "/cheats 1" and similar)
 +	Swap players/resources in graphs (to see "who made the most wood?" instead of "did Lewin make more stone than wood?"), add GDP for a test [Krom]
 +	Player selector in replays to make it easier to change which stats/FOW you are viewing (easier than selecting one of their units/houses) [Krom]


Finishing up:
 +	Message log
 +	Finish new MapEd features (add ADD_WARE_TO_LAST)
 +	SP maps list will keep jumping to the top while items are being added (you can't scroll down until scanning is done)
 +	Example maps that show what can be done with new scripts (more can be added later)
 +	Decide which script commands will be implemented for this release and implement them (can add more as requested)
 +	Lock icon next to password protected servers
 +	Finish AI stuff (defending and attacking prototype?)
 +	Performance test city builder and optimise/fix slow stuff (NextToOre using FindNearest for example)
 +	Remove falling trees and block from MapEd trees palette, re-add reed
 +	Improve snow falling random noise so it looks more natural [Krom]
 +	Indent messages after each line break so you can't fake system messages
 +	Before RC remove unused strings from LIBX and compact indexes [Lewin]
 +	Before RC search for all todos and @Lewin/@Krom comments to see if there's something important we forgot about
 +	Press release for our site where we collect all the big features and improvements [Lewin]


Known issues to fix:
 +	MP maps are still using auto generated goals. Do we keep it like that? Yes, but "Special" maps don't have auto goals so scripts can customise it
 +	Campaign/tutorials show warnings about showing messages with goals being depreciated, make tool to fix them [Krom]
 +	Fix "Vortamic" and "On the Way" texts (need to get texts 560..564) [Lewin]
 +	ALL MP maps need SET_USER_PLAYER set for them. Make a tool to fix this [Krom]
 +	Publish a memo about SET_USER_PLAYER "fixing" maps made in other editors [Lewin]
 +	Copy data\sfx\knights\battle4.wav to Polish sfx (horse sound Pol is missing) [Lewin]


Balance/exploits:
 +	Increased market loss ratio to 2.2
 +	Tested: 4 farms (with unsown fields) + 2 stables beats 6 woodcutters (with 5 grown trees each) + 1 market in horse production by 16% (20 mins), 30% (30 mins), 45% (40 mins), 77% (60 mins)
 +	Stop builders emptying towers (builders refuse to walk into range of a tower and cancel the plan)


Maps:
 +	Iceline (thunder)
 +	PAKER's maps
 +	Clavicus Valley & Battle of Octumn (Ben)
 +	Majestic Waters (TDL)
 +	Final Frontier (To)
 +	Pizza's map
 +	czechboss' new map
 +	Shark Islands (andreus and vovets1)
 +	Pawel's fixes for campaign missions that he emailed to us
 +	New coop missions and fixes to coop missions (from andreus, pawel)


Not for this release, maybe next time:
	Pawel's flower
	Increase player limit to 10?
	File transfers
