As you walk over the mountain, you hear the fallen soldiers' voices whose blood the land is wet of. No-one knows the number of casualties of the war, just that it is still not over. Some spies report to you that some neighboring villages formed an alliance on the opposite mountain, and they seem to be agressive. The choice is yours. You must set up a village and take over the iron mines of the desert between you and your enemies. Use your resources carefully, since they are limited, and we have to share it with our allies. The desert is quite dry and hot already, and spring has only just started. No time left to wait, you must act now, before the weather becomes even worse. Defeat your enemies in the final battle and bring peace upon this land after years of war! To thy weapons! |Made by Thunder<HU>, Story by Bence
