Our Armageddon is upon us. The terrors of the earth's depths have broken through the land. Countries have diminished, laws have been disbanded, and wars are lighting flames faster than the scorching streams of lava. Here, in this valley of death, the volcanoes bellow and the molten rock flows like water. It is here that you will recover that which was lost. Rebuild the army, gather the supplies, fight back those who would oppose you, and prepare for the end of days.||Made by To.|Story by Ben.
