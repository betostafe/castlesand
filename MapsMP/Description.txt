Each folder represents a single map (named MAP_NAME through this document).

Folder name should match MAP_NAME

Folder contains all required map files. So far these are:
 - MAP_NAME.txt which contains map properties and description shown in menu
 - MAP_NAME.dat which is a script file of the map
 - MAP_NAME.map which is map terrain
 - MAP_NAME.mi temporary file created by the game which stores the map/mission info so it is not necessary to scan the files each time. It can be safely deleted.
 - MAP_NAME.script dynamic script file
 - MAP_NAME.eng.libx Translation file for text used in dynamic script
other files may be included later
