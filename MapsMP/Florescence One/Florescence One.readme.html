<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>Surrounded by cliffy, some say even craggy mountains lies the kingdom of Matahua. In the neighboring kingdoms, all over the country, the golden medieval age began. Harvests were plenty, diseases little. People were to enjoy life, they were wealthy and healthy enough to grow interest in the land. The kingdom of Matahua however was nearly cut from these developments due to its remote site. The king was wise enough to see his people's desire for wealth, so he did one momentous call: he introduced tourism. The next day, heralds rode through the deep, central valley and proclaimed the following message to the 8 provinces:<br>
A holiday brochure shall be drawn and illustrated by the monks and priests of the local monastery. Each and every province shall begin and start immediately and at once to build und develop their place and town. A rating will be established and issued where every specialty and characteristic will be honored and awarded.<br>
And while the ordinary people still thought to themselves: 'wtf', the heralds rode into the sundown and disappeared.<br><br>
The moral of the story: medieval people don't understand and it's up to you to do what needs to be done.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>
You must build a town that is better than those of your opponents. Like in a hotel rating, there are symbols that indicate certain achievements in your town. For the symbols, flags will be used.<br><br>
Once you've overstepped a certain limit, tourist become interested. Keep that interest for 3 minutes and you will win the race.<br>
The catch is, every flag can only be awarded to one person. But as soon as one of your opponents surpasses you, you will lose this flag and the opponent gets to hold it. There are 15 categories where a flag is awarded, each category aims at different aspects of town development. The number of flags you must hold in order to win depends on the number of players on the map.<br>
There is another catch: the provinces declared that they do not wish a civil war because of all that mess and the difficulty of cleaning blood from coarse stone roads, so the city center of each town must not be entered by military units. Enter your opponents area and the king will arrest and put them to death. However, the central valley is not pacified, so you can play war there. This means, you cannot win the match with military forces only. But you are very likely to need them to get the upper hand in the central valley.</p>
<h1 id="funwithflags">Fun with Flags</h1>
<p>This game mode is called <span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Fun with Flags</span></p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>In order to win, you have to collect certain achievements which are called Flags. As soon as you own the majority of flags, a countdown will be started. If you don't lose your flags until the end of the countdown, you win the match. The countdown length is 3 minutes.<br><br>
The flags are not physical things on the map, but achievements like for example 'have the most timber'. As long as you have more timber than your opponents, you will own this flag. If one opponents produces more timber than you have, you lose the flag and the opponent gets it. The amount of timber is called 'flag score', because it's the score that decides who owns this flag.<br><br>
There are 15 flags. The amount of flags you need to win depends on the number of players. If there are only 2 players, you need 10 flags, whereas with 8 players you will only need to hold 5 flags in order to win.<br><br>
There will be 4 classes of flags which behave differently:</p>
<ul id="flagtypes">
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Future Flags</span> (5 total):<br>These flags are locked at the beginning of the game and will be unlocked after a certain amount of time, for example 20 minutes. As soon as the match time reaches the 20 minutes, this flag will be given to the person with the highest flag score. Everybody can fight for these flags, so if your opponent out-scores you, you will lose the flag and he will win it.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Fact Flags</span> (4 total):<br>They behave like the future flag, except that they are not unlocked at a specific time, but only as soons as the first person reaches a specific flag score. So if the limit is 200 for the timber flag, it will be given to the player who has 200 timber. We will still hold it if he falls below the 200 timber, but we will lose it as soon as another player has more timber than he has atm.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">First Flags</span> (4 total):<br>They behave like fact flags, which means they are unlocked as soon as one player reaches a certain limit. But you cannot fight for these flags and you cannot lose it. So the first player gets this flag and owns it for the rest of the match, even if he again falls below the limit or other players outrun him.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Final Flags</span> (2 total):<br>These are personal flags, so you don't fight with the others for these flags, but you fight with the limit. If you reach the limit, you will own this flag. If you again fall below the limit, you will lose it. This flag can exist more than once, so all 8 players can own this flags at the same time. You can't steal this flag from others.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to form teams. Each player still competes on the flag for his own, but the number of flags is summed up and take as the score of the team. So it is even possible to play mixed teams/single players. However, final flags only count as 1 flag per team, regardless of the number of flag holds in that team. As long as the team has at least one holder of a final flag, the team will have the score of 1 on this flag.</p>
<ul id="flagdescription">
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Wooden Leg</span> (fact flag, starting at: 50)<br>The number of wooden weapons minus the number of iron weapons produced.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Restaurant</span> (fact flag, starting at: 360)<br>It's basically the number of food, weighted for nutrition. Each wine gives 3, each bread 5 and each sausage gives 7 flag points. There is no fish on this map. I plan to add a multiplier which takes into account the number of inns, maybe give 10 extra % per inn.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Forechecking</span> (fact flag, starting at: 5)<br>It's the number of demolished (already fully built, not only planned) enemy buildings.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Fighter</span> (fact flag, starting at: 60)<br>Each killed enemy unit gives a certain flag score. Militia & bowman give 1 point. Axe fighter and lacer carrier give 2 points. Crossbowmen, pikeman and scouts give 3 points. Swordfighters give 5 points and a knight gives 7 points.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Comfort</span> (future flag, starting time: 15min)<br>The number of produced tree chunks plus coal plus straw.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Luxury</span> (future flag, starting time: 30min)<br>Number of gold plus wine plus sausage.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Vegetarian</span> (future flag, starting time: 45min)<br>The number of bread plus the number of wine minus the number of sausage.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Sightseeing</span> (future flag, starting time: 60min)<br>The number of barracks plus schools plus stables plus towers plus markets plus gold and iron mines minus (minus!) coal mines. Marketplace is not available until 60 minutes from the beginning and will be unlocked with this flags. However, weapon trades are forbidden - tourists don't need to buy weapons, do they?</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Commander</span> (fact flag, starting time: 75min)<br>It's number of living soldiers plus the number of killed soldiers minus the number of lost soldiers. Fights are possible in the central valley of the map, you can move your troops there.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">City</span> (first flag, score: 25)<br>The number of finished buildings divided by a spreading factor. If you have the same number of buildings of each type, the spreading factor will be 1, so the number of buildings will be one. On the other extreme, if you have a city consisting of say 1000 towers and nothing else, the spreading factor will also be 1000, so the overall score will be 1 (despite the 1000 buildings).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Iron fetish</span> (first flag, score: 150)<br>It's the number of iron plus the number of leather (the actual resources, not the armors) produced.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Variety</span> (first flag, score: 38)<br>You need to have 1 building of each type and 1 living unit of each type to get this flag = 38 units+buildings in total (market and fisherman are not required).</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Strategist</span> (first flag, score: 5)<br>You need to equip 5 soldiers of each type to get this flag.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Population</span> (final flag, limit: 160)<br>You have this flag, as long as you have 160 citizens. Recruits are citizens, military troops are not. So if you levy an army, it's possible to lose this flag. Also each starved civilian gives you a permanent malus on this score.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight:bold; color:white">Knighthood</span> (final flag, limit: 20)<br>You'll own this flag as long as you have 20 living knights.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="forbiddenzone">Forbidden Zone</h3>
<p>The entry of each location is protected by a forbidden zone, that covers the whole entrance. You will see the beginning of the forbidden stone marked by stones lying in a line. The king explicitly wished to have no civil war. So if any of your troops cross the stone line, they will be punished - by death penalty. No mercy on that, troops have to stay inside the valley.<br>
It is important to note that this is also true for teammates. You must not enter the base of your ally. It's not allowed and your troops will die in the forbidden zone of your teammate, too. You may only enter your own base.<p>
<h3 id="additional">Additional</h3>
The number of flags needed to win depends on the number of players.
<ul>
  <li>1 player/team - 11 flags</li>
  <li>2 players/teams - 10 flags</li>
  <li>3 players/teams - 9 flags</li>
  <li>4 players/teams - 7 flags</li>
  <li>5 players/teams - 6 flags</li>
  <li>6 players/teams - 6 flags</li>
  <li>7 players/teams - 5 flags</li>
  <li>8 players/teams - 5 flags</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have wish a faster match, you may want to add additional AI players to the match. They won't do any good, but they count as players, too. So the overall number of flags needed is decreased.<br>
As soon as one player/team has reached enough flags, a countdown will be started. During the countdown, each the tourists come and leave some money. Expect to gain 1 gold chest every 30 seconds for each teammate during the countdown. If you lose a flag during countdown or your opponents catch up with the number of flags, the countdown will abort. Beware, flags are not shared, not even for teammates. So if your teammate catches up on score for a flag you have, you will lose this flag and therefore the team will lose this point.</p>
