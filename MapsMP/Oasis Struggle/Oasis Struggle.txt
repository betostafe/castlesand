An 8 player multiplayer map made by Ben. The center of the map is filled with a lake; with 8 players located around it. Players must go around the lake to reach each other. Like border rivers, players are grouped closely in couples, so teams must be 1+2, 3+4, 5+6, and 7+8, however, the most recommended setting is 1+2+3+4 vs. 5+6+7+8.
