Waterfall pools are overflowed. It's only a matter of time, when these mighty waters gain the only right to rule this land. Peace shall come once again, just not in the way we could've ever imagined...||It's our only chance to escape, otherwise we will be prisoned here! We must break through any obstacle that stands in our way!||Can be played in 2 different ways.||Prisoners escape: 1238 vs 4567||Standard fighting: 1234 vs 5678|||Map made by andreus, idea by vovets1, story by Tiank.
