This map offers an opurtunity for an excellent game when no more than three people are in a lobby. The Tyrant (location 1) rests behind a wall and starts with enough resources to quickly field a strong army. The farmers (locations 2 and 3) have numbers but are restircted to primitave weapons. Teams must be 1 vs. 1+2||Made by Ben and inspired by Nick's single map "Smart".
