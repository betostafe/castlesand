"As the war rages, the value of every unclaimed piece of land grows ever so slightly; even such lands that were previously considered uninhabitable. Currently, our eyes are set on the wetlands to the east, where the enemy is already setting up camp. Because of the marshy terrain, building space is very limited. Our supplies are already running low, and the enemy masses just within sight of our encampment. Verily, we will need to take drastic measures to overcome the hazardous conditions that beset us."||Made by To.
