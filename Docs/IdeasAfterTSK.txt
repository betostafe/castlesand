
	Here I suggest to write down ideas for KaM Remake after it reaches TSK replica status
	My main concern is to keep TSK spirit through it while making gameplay better
	

Find a way to replenish fish in seas:
- Allow Fisher to add fish to sea
- Make fish replinish by itself

Introduce "Fog of war"

Add "demolish" task for laborers - so they could remove rocks and trees out of the buildings way

Order to expell(?) resources out of the house

Walls building
wooden and stone

Orders to plant/chop trees

On/Off switch for unit (citizen) interaction

Roadsigns objects, buildable?
They will feature some short texts on them

Add new house: WatchTower
Sight range = 20+
Owner=recruit
Reveals FOW while owner is inside

Add new house: Fish-dryers, it will take fish in buckets and dry it up on the sun (similar to Tannery)
Add new resource - dried fish

Add new house - retirement houses, unemployed/homeless citizens will spend their time there. In return their condition will decrease x3 slower, hence they will need less food.

Add new houses - clocktower (with working clocks and bell), well (no idea), tavern (shows gossip info on enemies), training grounds for army (promote soldiers to veterans without combat), marketplace (converts resources at rediculously high ratios, e.g. 10wood=1gold),
