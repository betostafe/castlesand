Savegame format:

savegame should be a self-sufficient game state including everything needed to resume gameplay. In theory it should be an alternative to map-script combo, a sort of wrapped package ready-to use. Hence:

	Terrain (only required fields, exclude deduced ones)

	Players assets
	- units/houses/lists

	Players AI states

	TickCounter and random seed value (to preserve course of events after loading)
		do we need it? arguable, but we can add it and use only on demand.

	Interface state (unread messages queue)

	Mapname and everything else derived from map description
		arguable
