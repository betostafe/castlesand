
	Flaws of existing systems: Player sees that deliveries are not optimal

	1. Serfs bring "demand" and walk out with empty hands because other serf already "booked" the "offer",
	   in worse case he will just stand idling in front. 
	2. If serfs bring "demand" and take "offer" they need to cancel other serfs "booking" on the "offer", 
	   other serf will halt and saty idle en-route or even worse - go in reverse direction


	There's a new idea by Rayzel:

	Let the house know how many sefs are bringing goods to it and approximate time it will take each of them to arrive.
	Then new serfs asking for delivery could check that count and ETA versus existing resources in house (and maybe production ETA).
	Depending on that check they may or may not take the delivery.
	This way serfs won't go to a house that has already "booked" output and serfs that bring "demand" are safe to take "offer" immediately.
	Voila! - Optimized deliveries where serfs always try to take resources from the house they went into and 
	player sees no serfs aborting their walks.


	Of course there are recurring issues:
	"offer" may be already booked by some serf coming from the other end of the town, then don't take it
	But generally serfs will work more efficiently
