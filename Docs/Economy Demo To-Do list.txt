4th "Bug Fix" Demo should include/fix:

-	Buggy stone mining - in some maps, e.g. 15 TSK, stonemasons get stuck after grabbing a stone, because of the changing elevation and angle (the tile below them becomes unwalkable). Building a road near the trapped stonemason causes an error message like the described before, but then nothing bad happens - he just go home and keep working. [To Discuss]
-	Rectangle below cursor is not fixed (happens on GeForce GT240M, 195.62 drivers, no problem on older 6800XT / 91.47) [Krom]
-	Various reported instabilities regarding troop movement
-	Troop voices

+	Some saves are impossible to load due to the range check error (bug in TKMPointTagList.Load) [Lewin]
+	Instabilities due to rare circumstances causing routes with canWalkRoad to fail when floodfill succeeds [Lewin]
+	Demolishing the building manually exits from the building menu, unlike in KaM, where it takes back to the building selection [Lewin]
+	Load/Save buttons have different order [to KaM], it's a bit confusing [Lewin]


3rd Demo should include:

+	Unit interaction [Lewin]
+	Wares distribution [Lewin]
+	Save/Load [Krom]
+	Soldiers walking bug-free as groups [Lewin]
+	Show proper error message when route cannot be built [Lewin]
+	Show proper error message and return to main menu/game if load fails or file doesn't exist [Lewin]
+	Change save file type to .sav rather than .txt [Krom]
+	Height effects passability [Lewin]
	Update Readme file [Krom/Lewin]
