"Bug Fix" Demo should include/fix:

+	The woodcutters planting animation is not visible, he simply disappears and reappears when he is done planting.
+	The woodcutter doesn't cut down trees, until all the available spots have been planted. In the original KaM a woodcutter would always cut down fullgrown trees in the first place, and only plant trees when there is nothing to cut down. (TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav) (trees appeared to be fully grown a few minutes before they can be cut)
+	Troop/house buttons not working after clicking on terrain with them selected
+	Laborers are sometimes being trapped inside a digged construction plan (Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav)
+	Range check error in TPR7, (TRB 2010-02-19 Range Check Error.rar) caused by group dying
+	Death task should not wait for action to finish, it should override any action under any circumstances. Otherwise strange things can happen visually e.g. dead units can be "pushed" using interaction sometimes not showing death animation.
+	In game settings uses old sytle brightness control.
+	Main menu options page doesn't refresh if you change the settings in game.
+	After digging house area workers will not continue to walk over other construction sites after leaving the one they made
+	Terrain is now flattened under houses placed at mission start
+	Demolished houses now leave a dug tile where the road used to be, rather than it just disappearing which looked odd (TK's suggestion)


-	Because the delivery queue prefers closer deliveries, wares will always be delivered to closer buildings. (e.g. with two swine farms, closer one will get all the corn) Same with coal mines. (coal mines in Kuba 2010-02-19 Stuck Workers save09.sav, swine farms in TRB 2010-02-19 Wood and Swine save01.sav)
-	I got a access violation when I was deleting my fisherman.
- when starting the game first time after system boot-up the Windows Explorer stops responding for a minute (Windows 7 x64)
-	If you destroy a house, odd things happen to the occupant(s). e.g. not appearing, jittering, appearing at wrong spot
-	Houses/units from the mission file should not place if they are on unwalkable terrain (including height test)


? (Probably fixed, can't test because statusbar doesn't show for me) F11 statusbar shows wrong map size (look at my previous save, it says 64*64 on 176*176 map)
?	(Can't reproduce, probably caused by worker-construction site issues that have been fixed now) Walk failed in TPR7 "Unit Laborer unable to walk a route from (97;29) to (98;30) during task Idle since the route is unbuilt" (TRB 2010-02-19 Walk Failed.rar)


Remaining from r698:

-	Rectangle below cursor is not fixed (happens on GeForce GT240M, 195.62 drivers, no problem on older 6800XT / 91.47) [Krom]
-	Troop voices



Fixed in r698:

+	Confusing fish run-out messages
+	"Unknown unit type in Savegame" due to dead but not yet destroyed units not saving unit type [Lewin]
+	Weapons producing houses did not show produced weapons correctly, only one weapon of each type was displayed
+	Range Check Error in GetSlide function due to PrevPos being two tiles away from NextPos (fix unconfirmed, but 99% certain) [Lewin]
+	Buggy stone mining - in some maps, e.g. 15 TSK, stonemasons get stuck after grabbing a stone, because of the changing elevation and angle (the tile below them becomes unwalkable). Building a road near the trapped stonemason causes an error message like the described before, but then nothing bad happens - he just go home and keep working.
+	Some saves are impossible to load due to the range check error (bug in TKMPointTagList.Load) [Lewin]
+	Instabilities due to rare circumstances causing routes with canWalkRoad to fail when floodfill succeeds [Lewin]
+	Demolishing the building manually exits from the building menu, unlike in KaM, where it takes back to the building selection [Lewin]
+	Load/Save buttons have different order [to KaM], it's a bit confusing [Lewin]
+	Stuck (trapped) fish (especially in "Across the Desert") would try to use canWalk to solve interaction resulting in crashes [Lewin]
+	Returning to road did not use A* efficiently and so would fail over long distances [Lewin]


3rd Demo should include:

+	Unit interaction [Lewin]
+	Wares distribution [Lewin]
+	Save/Load [Krom]
+	Soldiers walking bug-free as groups [Lewin]
+	Show proper error message when route cannot be built [Lewin]
+	Show proper error message and return to main menu/game if load fails or file doesn't exist [Lewin]
+	Change save file type to .sav rather than .txt [Krom]
+	Height effects passability [Lewin]
+	Update Readme file [Krom/Lewin]
