21/12/10 - Tested AI Defence Position behaviour in KaM and recorded facts (Lewin)


Formation:
1. If defence formation is not specified, AI will form warriors into groups that are 3x3 (9 men, 3 rows)
2. AI will link excess warriors into groups of specified size but not position them anywhere
3. AI will increase formation to 3 rows, but never decrease it (if group starts off as 10 rows when only 4 is recomended, it stays as 10)
4. AI will not split groups that are larger than the specified amount (if group starts off as 20 men when only 12 are recomended, it stays as 20)


Positioning:
5. AI will put the biggest groups of each type in the first (script order) defence positions, (first in, best dressed) and if a group becomes larger, they get moved "forward" to the earlier positions


=======================
Suggestions for Remake:
=======================
1: To be used
2: To be used
3&4: Currently we force groups into fixed formation/size, splitting out excess warriors. This MIGHT be a "problem" in some missions (e.g. check the battle tutorial, groups are being split which is wrong. Either script must change or engine) Maybe we should not reduce groups with excess?
5: We occupy first defined positions first, but will not rearrange the order just because one group becomes larger. I think this is fine. (there is too much shuffling otherwise)
