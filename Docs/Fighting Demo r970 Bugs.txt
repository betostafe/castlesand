This file is for tracking bugs/changes after r970 release.


Fixed:
 + Rock throwing uses wrong alliance setting
 + Map editor won't let you place citizens off roads
 + Map editor main menu labels 'Width' x 'Height'
 + Masked edit allows for unlimited size
 + Scroll wheel now functions correctly on filelist and updates the scrollbar position
 + Zooming with the scroll wheel now only works when over the map (not a control)
 + Briefings: on fullscreen (1366*768) the message jumps over the right edge of the screen
 + "Unit walk not fRouteBuilt" error. (Issue 28)
 + Clicking on anything during gameplay will shift viewport a little
 + StoneMines mission in r977 crashes on 39min for some delivery being performed twice 
 + Multiple units added with ct_SetUnitByStock will stand on one tile after autoplacement fails (~80+ units)
 + Occupied tile has no unit on it (Issue 27) (same as above)
 + Finished delivery will abandon again if unit dies while waiting to exit from destination house
 
Known:
 - Send troops from A to B, they start walking. If send them to C while they walk, they continue walking to B first and then to C instead of changing their way to C immediately.
 - While destroying a building, soldier can start attacking a citizen walking nearby - he should do that only with soldiers
 - Menu buttons in replay don't work, no way to exit other than F11
 - Message should be displayed when replay reaches end (e.g. replay complete, would you like it to continue?)
 - Dots and lines displaying on tile edges. For an example go to town tutorial, reveal entire map, go to the chasom (black with bridge) and scroll past it. 1px dots and lines of color appear through out it. It happens on other terrain but it's most noticable there. [assigned to Krom]
