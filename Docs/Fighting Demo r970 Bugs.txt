This file is for tracking bugs/changes after r970 release.


Fixed:
 + Rock throwing uses wrong alliance setting
 + Map editor won't let you place citizens off roads
 + Map editor main menu labels 'Width' x 'Height'
 + Masked edit allows for unlimited size
 + Scroll wheel now functions correctly on filelist and updates the scrollbar position
 + Zooming with the scroll wheel now only works when over the map (not a control)
 + Briefings: on fullscreen (1366*768) the message jumps over the right edge of the screen
 
Known:
 - "Unit walk not fRouteBuilt" error. (Issue 28)
 - Occupied tile has no unit on it (Issue 27)

 - Menu buttons in replay don't work, no way to exit other than F11
 - Message should be displayed when replay reaches end (e.g. replay complete, would you like it to continue?)
 - Dots and lines displaying on tile edges. For an example go to town tutorial, reveal entire map, go to the chasom (black with bridge) and scroll past it. 1px dots and lines of color appear through out it. It happens on other terrain but it's most noticable there. [assigned to Krom]
