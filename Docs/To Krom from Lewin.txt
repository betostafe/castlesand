I thought I'd make this file so I can report stuff to you which I don't feel confident fixing myself.

 - If you try to place a road/winefield/field on the left most edge of the map, then it crashes with an error. Same thing if you try to place a building on sqaure away from the edge. Terrain is your area, so prehaps you could...

FONT TROUBLES: (see image FontTroubles.gif, remake left, KaM right)
 - New line doesn't seem to work with the font files. It is required for many places such as unit descriptions, briefings, etc. Oh and spaces don't seem to work either. (or else they don't work much ;) )

ANSWER: I can make it work. (Krom)
End-of-lines are added. Spaces are faked in ReadGFX by altering Letter[32] which is space character

REPLY: End of line changed to #124, which is what KaM uses in the LIB files.
The spacing between characters is actually -1, not 0. However, this doesn't apply to all fonts. I will fix it in my next commit.



Less important:
 - If you ask it to get the coordinates (to display in statusbar) for something past 176 then it crashes. If you load up mission 20 and move you mouse off the edge of the screen this happens. This will probably be fixed when we disallow scrolling past edges 

ANSWER: There's variable MaxMapSize=176 somewhere in Global_Data or Terrain unit. I have a request, keep it 176 for now, as it will help to solve compatibility issues (just like those you've mentioned). Once it's all solved the limit can be increased to any value (though exceeding 256 will introduce new bugs, I'm sure).
