Lewin	- Fullscreen resolution change
	- Armies (thats not a bug, but we need either to disable them or to make groups working)
Krom	- Implement feedback system, so we know at least something on crashes [Replaced every Assert with AppendLog+Assert]
Krom	- Remove debug stuff where it's not needed 
Krom	- Remove all unit interaction stuff (esp. things that cause crashes) [Removed under DO_UNIT_INTERACTION switch]
Krom	- Remove FastMM debug mode [Done, see IFDEF KAM_USE_FASTMM_DEBUG_MODE switch in KaM_Remake]
Clean up menu, single maps and decide which missions we will ship with the demo (perhaps make a few more)
