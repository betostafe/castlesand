Lewin	- Fullscreen resolution change
	- Armies (thats not a bug, but we need either to disable them or to make groups working)
Clean up menu, single maps and decide which missions we will ship with the demo (perhaps make a few more)


Top prioraty items from Lewin's todo list: (Anyone can fix these)
 - Abandon walk when house plan is canceled [Seems very complicated to implement because worker is not associated with task in delivery system] {Looks like a bug IMHO}
