KaM Remake Economy Demo 090728 (r363)
<===================================================================================>
Known bugs:

+	Tree (cut by woodcutter?) will fall down repeatedly forever
+	Mainmenu is not shown on F11 toggle
	"979ms	Gameplay error ... done" follows "route unbuilt" error
	Some texts don't fit in the left panel (e.g. "Preparing house area")
	See-through hills (lighting flaw)			//Assigned to Krom
	Workers forget to build roads sometimes (probably same as woodcutter, units sometimes abandon their task without cleaning up)
	Built road comes as unfinished "brown spot" (due to above bug)
	Remove debug info
	Fisher
	Time freeze bug
	Field building on map edges
	Schoolhouse bug (citizen statistics acts wrong on training/cancel)
	MediaPlayer won't play mp3s and crash
+	Resource cheat is not strict enough
	Units should return to road first then go eat, home, etc.
	Splash screen failed to disappear
	Placing a building plan and removing it, the game returned a "Range check error"
	TUnitAction is being overrun for some reason - error
	Destroying barracks and unfinished houses results in crash (@Krom: I cannot reproduce either of these. Can you? As for unfinished houses, I think it is probably units getting stuck again or something. (or possibily worker abandoning early just before leaving the house area?) No idea about the barracks, it destroys fine for me, even with recruits and weapons)
	Water has dark patches					//Assigned to Krom
	Wrong render of houses, black tops (see GraphicFlaws folder)	//Assigned to Krom
	Units get stuck under houses being built and cause "route cannot be made" errors

Make sure these are checked:	//Assigned to Krom
	True/false switches in KM_Defaults
	Pack EXE file
	Include OpenAL distributive
	Test installer and Demo
