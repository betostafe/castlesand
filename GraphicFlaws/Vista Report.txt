I tried it on my dad's Vista laptop. (at revision 346 with a few of my changes from revision 348) It's a very powerful computer so I expected good results. However, there were quite a lot of graphic flaws:

 - The cursor seemed to have an issue with transparencey. The part that should be transparent was a visible, colourful square. Not a massive problem though, it's still usable. I've seen this in KaM somewhere before BTW, I can't remember...
 - The elevation didn't work properly. It was on the whole too flat and there was very little shading. (no dark and bright patches, all kind of normal) Also some sharp edges that looked bad.
 - The edge of unexplored areas was perfectly sharp. There was no smooth fading, it was just black then fully visible.
 
The game still played ok, I didn't see any other problems. (and none of those really affect the game play, they just make it look bad)

I did have a screenshot of all of this but I didn't copy it correctly, so I can't show you. I'll see if I can find it and send it to you later or take another shot.
The OpenGL version in the main menu was 2.1.2. I thought this might be important because it's a lot greater than the one I have. (1.4.0)

Here is some info from dxdiag that I thought might help:
