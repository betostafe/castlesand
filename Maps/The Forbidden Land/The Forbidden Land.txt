BigDesc
We are being attacked by the evil king who lives north, in the forbidden land. (Reinforcements will arrive soon.) Soldiers came through a tunnel in the mountain, but it collapsed on the other side.
You have been given an army, some serfs and a labourer, they will help you build a new village just on the other side of the wall.
The enemy will traget it to our main village(ally). Try to defend it as much as you can and save the land from all evil!
