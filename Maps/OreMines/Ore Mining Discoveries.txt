Incomplete, some notes I took while testing KaM mining.

ALL:
 - Resource does not need to be in the same hill (can be disconnected from mine)
 - ALL mines use the gradient system
 - In KaM they mine bottom right to top left, but we can keep it random
 
COAL:
 - Will mine one tile further on the RIGHT side (as that is where the mine shaft is?)
 - Will remove 4 (all) from a radius of 1 from the house
 - Will remove 3       from a radius of 2 from the house
 - Will remove 2       from a radius of 3 from the house
 - Never removes just 1
            

GOLD:
?????:
 - Will take all from radius 8
 - Will leave 1 at radius 9
 - Will leave 2 at radius 10
 - Max mine up = 9

IRON:
