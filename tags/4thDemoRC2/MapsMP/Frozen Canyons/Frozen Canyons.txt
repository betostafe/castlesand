BigDesc
The land is plunged into a bitterly cold winter. Deep snow caps the mountain tops and covers vast fields in the mountain villages, though this time the folk are prepared, and a large harvest was stocked. Nevertheless, fertile lands are scarce enough, and are not to be shared with some mere intruder at this time of year. Prepare thy arms!|Hint: Woodcutters will only plant on dirty snow terrain.||Made by caykroyd.
