A mission by The Dark Lord

BigDesc
The Kingdom of Skivic is under rule of king Lavaraille. King Lavaraille is a great tactician. He hasn't lost a single battle. But now that Lavaraille has left Skivac (the capital of Skivic) and the Governor of Ciostenia (our ally) is inside Skivac, our enemy sees an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone! In the first place, they want to capture Skivac. That is almost impossible while king Lavaraille is there, but now that he is temporarily gone, they see their chance. Secondly, our enemy wants to kill the Governor, so that Ciostenia is leaderless. It is your job and the Governor's job to stop the attack. Show them that not only Lavaraille is brilliant!
