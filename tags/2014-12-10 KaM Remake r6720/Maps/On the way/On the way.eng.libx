1:Commander, Moorbachs troops aren't arround... This worries me. If they were ambushed by someone, we are on our own. It seems like this town straight ahead was theirs
2:Fortunately we were able to defend the town, but there are still enemies blocking our way to the Talon plain. I think those are mercaneries hired by Greenland. We expected before that we make any friends while infiltrating this territory, and passing the highlands surely wont be easy.|The best solution might be offensive tactics.
3:Our scouts have discovered some gold reserves in the far north, a high amount of stone in the east and fishing grounds in the southern lake. Keep in mind that we should build a second storehouse later, so we can decrease the crowding for the serfs!
4:Prepare for battle, the mercanaries will soon attack us without mercy! I think they will use a familiar strategy I meet before. I can't say for sure, but the mercanaries usually surround an Enemy, then attack from two directions, one side is focused on melee, the other on cavelry. I never thought they'd ally themselves with Greenland due to the fact that they're always peaceful and loyal for the Imperials. There must be a reason.
