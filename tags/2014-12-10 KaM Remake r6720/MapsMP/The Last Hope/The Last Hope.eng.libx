0:One of our villages opposed the Tyrant. The village still has some forces but they are weak and can't defend the village for a long time. Help them!
1:With armies like this we can't win... Come to the Villagers and ask for help. They are our last hope!
2:The Villagers: Our armies aren't so strong. But we can help you! Our forces will arrive soon.
3:Tyrant's armies are coming from northwest! To thy weapons!
4:Now destroy Tyrant's military base!
5:A small gift arrived from allied village! Use this gold to equip more troops.
6:The Tyrant knows that villagers helped us and probably will try to destroy them too. Send some troops to them!
