Here is a list of graphical problems relating to snow houses.
Most can be fixed by removing backgrounds from house overlays, keeping shadows (using chessboard style) where possible.


Backgrounds to remove from house overlays
 - Winefarm squashing animation covers snow on roof
 - Carpenter in weapons workshop covers snow on roof and post when working
 - 5 timber in weapons workshop covers some snow on roof
 - Coal, iron ore and iron in iron smelter covers snow on walls and roof
 - Corn in swine farm cover some bits of snow
 - Recruit idle and throwing animation in tower covers snow on roof
 - Mill working animation covers snow on roof
 - Mill, snow on roof is clipped
 - Carpenter in armour workshop covers snow on wall behind his head in both working and idle animations (shadows on wall to be kept)
 - Bread in bakery covers snow on table legs
 - Sawmill logs hides snow on fence
 - Corn in farm covers snow
 - Fish in fisherman's hut covers snow
 - Iron ore in iron mine covers snow


Other things to fix:
 - Pigs in swine farm cover some bits of snow. Makes Z order look wrong since snow now extends beyond original fence boundaries. Fix by clipping snow on fences to original fence pixels, so pig animations fit around it.
 - Pigs in swines yard probably should not have snow below (add some dirt like in Stables)
 - Shadow of mill blades on roof look odd (convert shadows to pixel chessboard like other shadows)
