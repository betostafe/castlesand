Deep within the the heart of the Kjlzxec Deathlands is a safe haven called Clavicus Valley, where King Clavicus fled in the aftermath of the Colovia-Hondorum war. The valley has laid mostly untouched since the days of Hondorum, but the landscape has changed dramatically. Your objective is to seize the deposits of ore that lie in the valley. However, your enemy has a similar objective, and they lay just across the river. But are they the real threat, or is it the dangers that lurk outside the valley?||Made by Ben.
