For many months, there has been a stalemate at the battlefield of Octumn. The armies have individually pitched camp on top of each one of the eight hills in the area; where they hope to regain strength. You've been sent to the area to help diffuse the situation. Take control of the camp, rebuild your army, and end the stalemate!||Made by Ben
