#summary Explanation of certain AI functionality

= Attacks =

AI attacks are defined by the following parameters:
 * Type (Repeating or Once)
 * Initial delay
 * Target
 * Number of soldiers to attack
 * Number of each group type, OR "choose randomly"

==Groups that can attack==
The only groups that can participate in AI attacks are:
 * Idle groups in a backline defence positions
 * Idle groups not in any defence position

==Trigger==

The AI attack is launched when all these conditions are satisfied:
 * If multiplayer, it must be after peacetime
 * Game time is at least *initial delay*
 * If the attack type is *Once*, the attack must not have occurred previously
 * The AI must have at least the *number of each group type* requested (unless *choose randomly* is set)
 * The total number of soldiers in the group types chosen (all groups if *choose randomly*) must be at least as large as *number of soldiers to attack*
