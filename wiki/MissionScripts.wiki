= Mission scripts =

Missions can be easily extended with custom scripts to add special events to them. Each missions script is located in `\Maps\map_name\map_name.script` file, which can be opened in any plain text editor (e.g. Notepad). Scripts are written in PascalScript language (syntax is very similar to usual Pascal).

Script has 3 ways of interacting with the game - *Events*, *States* and *Actions*. Events get called by the game when they happen. States are values that can be queried from the game. Actions are way to tell the game what to do. Scripts get verified on mission load and any errors are output in a message to a player.

Script file consists of several parts:

{{{
//Global variables section, accessible from any place in the script and stored in game memory
var
  I: Integer; //variable number
  A: array [0..3] of Boolean; //array of 4 booleans accessible as A[0], A[1] etc.

//Event handler, when the event happens ingame this function gets called
procedure OnHouseBuilt(..); //Ecah event has different input parameters list
var //Local variables, they exist only within this procedure
  L: Integer; //variable number 
begin
  //Event code
  L := 7; //assignment of number to a variable
  Actions.ShowMsg(0,L); //Calling a games action with 2 parameters: 0 and L
end;

//Main section which gets executed each game tick
begin
  //Code here
  if States.GameTime = 60 then //Check game time and show a message
    Actions.ShowMsg(0,3);
end. //script must end with a stop sign .
}}}

Here is Battle Tutorial script explained:

{{{
procedure OnPlayerDefeated(aIndex: Integer);
begin
  if aIndex = 2 then Actions.ShowMsg(0, 2);
  if aIndex = 3 then Actions.ShowMsg(0, 3);
  if aIndex = 4 then Actions.ShowMsg(0, 4);
end;

begin
  if States.GameTime = 20 then 
    Actions.ShowMsg(0, 1);
end.
}}}

Above line means that when PlayerDefeated event comes from the game, we check the index of the player that was defeated (aIndex) and issue a command to show certain message to specified player (0, who is human). Also, each tick we check the games time and on tick 20 we show another message.

Events are written in a form *procedure EVENT_NAME(EVENT_PARAMETERS);* like so:
{{{
procedure OnHouseBuilt(aIndex: Integer; aHouseType: Integer);
begin
  //code
end;
}}}

States are queried in a form *States.STATE_NAME(STATE_PARAMETERS)* like so:
{{{
if States.PlayerCount > 5 then
  A := States.UnitCount(1);
}}}
