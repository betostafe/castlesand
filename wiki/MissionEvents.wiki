Using simple syntax events can be added to custom missions. The events are stored in `\Maps\map_name\map_name.evt` file, which can be opened by any text editor (i.e. Notepad).

Each line is an event. First comes Trigger (that sets event off) with player index and parameters, then comes Action (what will happen) with player index and parameters as well.
