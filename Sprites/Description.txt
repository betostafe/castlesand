This folder contains replacement images for original KaM sprites.
In order to replace some sprite you should name it in following format:

#-####.tga	Standard sprite
#-####a.tga	Alternative sprite (used for team colors)

First digit is RX library index. Second array of 4 digits is sprite index.
For example to replace main menu logo use: 5-0004.tga

Images whose indexes are outside of original ranges will be ignored.
